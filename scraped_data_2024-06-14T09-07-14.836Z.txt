        "If you buy an apartment for 80 lakhs to 1 cr and put it up on Airbnb for 4000 rs a day, you will get around Rs. 2800 after taxes and charges. If you are able to get bookings for 200 days a year (given you are lucky), you will get roughly 5.6 lakhs per annum. If you buy a flat in Bangalore in a branded community for a similar price, you will get a fixed rent of 5-6 lakhs per annum with much lesser management stress and longer life of your paint, interiors, electricals and plumbing works. And of course, much better appreciation.\n\nAirbnb in Goa makes sense only if you buy a 2nd hand flat in the 50 lakh range. But that will not appreciate at all. Not every flat in a metro city costs 2 cr. You cannot count the cost in the prime areas which developed 30 years ago.",
        "Like who all watched Guruji video on this topic. Clarity for youth.",
        "He is selling course, don't fall into trap. He wants to make money by selling course",
        "This guy was promoting a big NO to real estate and promoting one now",
        "Thanks to Guruji from Gurugram people now have more clarity and don't fall for such fraudsters schemes.",
        "Being host on Airbnb for 7+ years and running 4 properties I feel this video is nice as an Airbnb ad. Not at all educational video and that course is big no no. I'm having second thoughts on his previous finance videos. Is he a real finfluencer. He is technically right but practically nothing makes sense. It's like saying jump from 50 feet you will land on feet or you may break leg or you may die. Only take away from video is rental yield is more in short term rental than long term rental depending on the market. Have lost faith in him after this video",
        "Here after listening to uncle ji from gurgaon and that that uncle ji is saying is on point. You have to understand the local indian nuances, politics, etc.",
        "Just one question Akshat, why would anyone travelling for a very short duration, let's say even 1-2 weeks, would cook food there ? This usecase is practical and correct for a country like US ( I lived there for 6-7 yrs) where getting food of liking is difficult for most PPL. But, in a country like India - buying food is not a problem. Why would someone expect their spouse to COOK or Wash Clothes, when the family is on VACATION, trying to ENJOY the Life and Vacation ??",
        "Guruji from gurugram ",
        "I am watching this video just because Guruji is giving clarity on this",
        "The girl at the end has great comm skills  Nicely explained",
        "I really appreciate Akshat's content, although I tend to steer clear of his real estate advice due to practical considerations.",
        "Don't get fooled by this person. He has to sell his course and create a content. My uncle who has retired from Navy has a Villa in Goa, not even 2% rental yield. Very few flats/ house/ villa has approx 6% rental yield, very few <1%. Don't forget hassle of documentation and if you are outsider, locals will not let you do airbnb. Don't get tempted by such cheaters.",
        "Hey akshat  !   \" clarity for  youth \" a channel led by AMIT SANGWAN HAD MADE AN EXPOSE  VIDEO  ON YOU AND on  idea  OF AIR BNB  .  He had pointed valid point against  you . Could you  counter  it . According to me he is right In every sense .",

        "What about maintenance cleaning after a guest leaves and giving salary to Airbnb manager?",
        "He just reads the story which probably anyone with information from internet can with good presenting skills while guruji is professor knows in and out",
