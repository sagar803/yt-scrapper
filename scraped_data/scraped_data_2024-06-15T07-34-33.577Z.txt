      "Will India's real estate market break all records in 2024? \nComment below and join the conversation.",
      "Because so many people overpaid for homes even while loan rates were low, I believe there will be a housing catastrophe because these people are in debt. If housing costs continue to drop and, for whatever reason, they can no longer afford the property and it goes into foreclosure, they have no equity since, even if they try to sell, they will not make any money. I believe that many individuals will experience this, especially given the impending mass layoffs and rapidly rising living expenses.",
      "The rising interest rate can surely control inflation, but won't prevent erosion of the eroding purchasing power of the US dollar. I have learnt my lesson this time. The banks can't be making money off my money, while inflation eats into it. I have set aside 650k to invest in the stock market now, since that keeps up with inflation, but I don't know how to get started.",
      "I don't know how well researched and real is this report. The reality is completely different, these are not the common people buying 5+cr flats , these are the big players buying.",
      "The best course of action if you lack market knowledge is to ask a consultant or investing coach for guidance or assistance. Speaking with a consultant helped me stay \tafloat in the market and grow my portfolio to about 65% since January, even though I know it sounds obvious or generic. I believe that is the most effective way to enter the business at the moment.",
      "For Gurgaon: 1.5 Cr is 1500sq.ft 2 BHK in upcoming areas.  Decent 3+ BHK (2100 sq ft) in new launch is 5 Cr+.  Central areas, it is costlier.   37% is out-of-pocket including govt. charges (non financeable).  1 recession and this will all come down crashing.",
      "Real estate boom is not necessarily a good thing.  It usually makes the housing less affordable.",
      "Real estate has become a mafia in India, middle class is unable to afford houses with no support from government most of the people will be homeless while rick corrupt people enjoy excess profits without paying any taxes",
      "If real estate goes above 15% of GDP, then the bubble will burst some day in the future.",
      "Without a doubt, this video is a real estate sponsored production. Finally Firstpost is no exception.",
      "The real estate boom we see now is primarily being driven by  NRIs..for it's rental/resale value. I have cousins settled abroad who own 2-3 apartments each in India in prime locations and rented it out..one of the first investments for NRIs is real estate in India...It is becoming increasingly difficult for the middle class Indian to afford a 2BHK in metro cities..please don't say that middle class are driving the boom...how many middle class Indians are able to afford a 2bhk for 80 lacs, which is the price in an average Chennai suburb\n Nowadays the trend has shifted to buying of land\nThe real estate market is in the hands of politicians, NRIs and few wealthy Indians today...out of reach of middle class...the government has to do something to stop this",
      "Go India. More powers to you from the Phil 🇵🇭🇮🇳\nI wish India/Bharat will be wealthier than China and become a superpower again someday just like in the ancient times.",
      "1113 flats sold in 72 hrs is a big joke because 1 year hard work is there to sell those thru EOI,channel partners, pre launch and lanuch  events.\nNot simply by 72 hrs.\nThat is how  real estate  co.goofing people by creating high demand.",
      "Good job India! Just don't let your real estate market end up like China's.",
      "Im from hyderabad,  were a midde class family. we have couple of houses whose land value has increased significantly. Now we're still middle class bc our salary and inflation prices are high. So to people who are assuming that having 1 crore or 1 M dollars is rich? You're absolutely wrong. House is not for sale and new house would cost crores. So we're still middle class just the numbers changed. We still can't afford anything luxurious and we dont live in posh locality.",
      "As a canadian please do not allow realestate prices to continue to grow. It will screw over the younger generation and it will cause massive inflation.\n\nHousing should always be a place to live and an investment as a distant second!",
      "Ncr and bengaluru these two went crazy. Basically 2x in last 3 years. Ncr specially lot of black money is there. 7 cr appartment service class cannot afford, it basically translates to 4 lakh emi means your post tax income should be around 1 cr. Hardly any jobs pay so much.",
      "Farmers are moving towards IT sector and businessman moving towards farming sector… \nSad truth of urbanisation …  \n\nThese media houses run by big corporates … So they will never let the sad news come out",
      "Awesome God bless India.",
      "Forget home in big city. Most youths like me can't buy a 2-3 bhk home even small city.. forget buying can't even do down payment.. they ask 30-40 lakhs.. can't downpayment even 25% in 5 years earning also.. this boom is kinda of curse for us.. and there is a major section who earns less than us..."

      "string": "this year an Indian realy major made an announcement its latest luxury residential project was ready it was located in gurugram in India's national capital region the project opened for pre-sale and within 72 hours it was sold out we are talking about 1,113 luxury Flats valued at 7,200 CR rupees all laed up in just 3 days in India buying a house is a big deal a social right of passage an emotional experience and a guarantee of Financial Security there's also a lot of sentimental value attached but is this sentiment alone driving India's real estate market or are there other forces at play 2023 was a bumper year for Indian real estate will 2024 be bigger and better that's what we'll discuss tonight hello and welcome I'm py Sharma and this is between the lines [Music] Our Story begins with India's independence here was a nation that had been looted and plundered for centuries now free of occupiers trying to rebuild itself so the focus was on accessibility not luxury AKA public housing projects the government launched many of them all over the country then came the land reforms of the 50s and 6s land was redistributed the next big shift came in the 1980s that's when private housing entered the market and with liberalization in the 1990s it grew further large scale projects came up your it Parks shopping malls big budget housing cut to 2024 India's real estate market is among the fastest growing in the world and it's evident if you live in an Indian Metro City go out and look around the cultures may be different the language may be different the food habits may be different but there's one thing you'll find everywhere skyscrapers and cranes the droning noise of construction is deafening but it's also defining every major Indian city in 2023 India's real estate market was worth around $265 billion by 2030 it will be worth $1 trillion and by 2047 5.8 trillion that is the projection imagine that a 12-fold rise between 2023 and 2047 which means a lot will change currently real estate contributes to 7% of India's GDP it employs over 50 million people cement steel glass all of these industries depend on real estate by 2047 it could make up for more than 15% of the country's GDP it will be a mammoth sector and the trends are clear in 2022 homes worth 3.27 lakh CR rupees were sold the next year it went up to 4 and a half lakh crores that's a 38% rise in just one year so the demand is strong but where are these people investing India has 7 top residential markets Mumbai Delhi NCR bangaluru Hyderabad Chennai Kolkata and Pune essentially the country's biggest cities and last year these cities sold a lot of houses more than 476,000 units in one year a 31% increase since 2022 so what's driving this surge a lot of factors but the biggest one is India's economy it is shining in an otherwise gloomy Global picture growth has been stable the fundamentals are strong India's central bank has not hied interest rates all of this has driven up demand plus with the economy India's middle class is also Rising they're earning more they have more disposable income and they're investing in real estate the government supports this it wants real estate to Boom so it's offering incentives there are tax reductions subsidies for for buyers and schemes for affordable housing but it's not just affordable that Indian buyers are seeking a lot of them also want luxury premium properties now first things first what defines luxury real estate in India it's typically anything priced over 1.5 CR rupees if you're in Mumbai it's anything above 2 and a half crores that's luxury these properties have a few defining factors they're in Prime neighborhoods they have amenities there's topnotch infrastructure state-of-the-art fitness centers infinity pools rooftop lounges coner Services shopping centers it's this attention to detail that makes them appealing and the rich want them in the first 6 months of 2023 the sale of luxury homes jumped by 130% it was 3,000 units in 2022 6,900 units in 2023 that's a 130% rise then there's Ultra luxury homes that's real estate priced at over 40 CR rupees last year sales for that Rose by 200% almost 600 such homes were sold in India's top Seven Cities the numbers may sound too good to be true but it's not happening out of the blue there have been signs and one of them is India's Rising affluent demographic by 2027 the number of millionaires in the country set to increase by 69% then there are the ultra high net worth individuals people with a net worth of $30 million and more in the next 3 years India will have at least 9 18,000 ultra high net worth individuals they want affluent Lifestyles and the first thing they want is luxury real estate and it's not just housing that's picking up there's demand for other segments as well I'm talking about your office spaces co-working spaces malls all of them have seen an uptick in sales also industrial spaces your warehouses dark stores demand for those is also Rising growing e-commerce businesses are fueling it and investors are tracking this surge in including foreign investors they want to invest in India's real estate in the first half of 2023 more than 4 billion dollars flowed into India this was in the form of private credit and half of it went to real estate so foreign investors want to invest here and they're dumping China for it China's property Market is going through a slump debt is piling companies are shutting shop and the middle class is battered foreign investors or any investors for that matter do not like such volatility so they're turning to India here they get a growing economy a favorable demographic and a stable government it's almost an easy choice and it's working out for in India's favor so to sum it up more people are buying houses more houses are being built foreign money is pouring it and it all looks very good but no success story is without challenges and India's real estate story has its own share of challenges the first is the cost of land it is rising across the country India is now the 14th priciest residential real estate market globally which means affordable Solutions are few and far between it's not like everyone can afford a 1 and a half CR rupee house then there are bureaucratic processes you find an affordable plot of land you want to buy it but you'll have to jump through hoops the red tape can be daunting plus there are legal challenges 16% of all properties are embroiled in some or the other legal case and then there's the issue of loans most buyers cannot pay for the full price of their house so they take loans it's a tedious process especially when you don't know when you'll get possession of your property it can often take years Builders can go bust buildings can be left under construction and all the while you pay high interest rates and property taxes so there's a lot to discourage people a lot that needs to be fixed having said that the sentiment Still Remains positive real estate is booming in India and it's it's expected to continue to grow in the years to come it's also a reflection of India's journey of a country where dreams are built and realized one brick at a [Music] time that",

      "Sir, property prices are out of 90% Indians peoples reach. The bussinesses profits, salaries and interests are not increases n property owners wants their money double at every 5 years. Some people make it full time bussiness of common peoples basic needs. The govt. have only interest in earning tax from properties. The paradox should fall at time of covid but any how builder n govt. lobby keep it stable but manipulation can't hide the truth. The overhyped blood sucking money of common people will not grow more time. I can clearly see people are afraid to buy houses at highly inflated prices.",
      "Clear & crisp explanation from Ashish sir!",
      "First honest property price outlook video I have ever seen. ",
      "Prices in real estate never crash, but  prices get stagnant for decades, resulting in bad investment for speculators.\nPeople sitting on the sidelines, waiting for prises to crash, never happens, and their dream of buying cheap always remains a dream.\nIt's cyclic and you should try to buy just before the upward trend is about to come, ufcource if you are lucky.",
      "Sir we as couple employees earning 2 lakh per month salary still not able to buy property as first time house buyers, buying a house for furst time buyers seems impossible we are wondering who us buying at these prices in tier 3 cities",

      "I see lot of right guidance here. Good content.",
      "Happy New year to all and thank you both for your painstaking efforts. The   \ncontent here are made very simple and easy to understand.",
      "Jab property lene jaao to dealer kehta \n“Maal nahi hai badi tezi hai property mehangi hai” \nJab property bechne jaao to dealer kehta \n“Bahut manda hai property nahi bik rahi market down hai property sasti bikegi” \nFlat le ka agle din 20% rate kam …. In dallo ki baat mat sune …. Apna paisa kharab mat kare",

बात करें या फिर स्मॉल सिटीज की बात करें तो यहां पे देखने को मिल रहा है कि एकदम मार्केट के अंदर रियल स्टेट के अंदर काफी बूम देखने को मिला है काफी सोल्ड आउट हो जाते हैं प्रॉपर्टी मिल नहीं रही है और ओवर प्राइस मिल रही है क्या यह हाउसिंग बबल हो सकता है क्या यहां से मार्केट क कर सकती है अगर हम रियल स्टेट की बात करें या फिर यहां पर और बूम देखने को मिला है क्या करना चाहिए 2024 के अंदर फ्लैट वर्सेस प्लॉट या फिर अगर हमें फॉर्मिंग लैंड लेनी है तो उसके कॉरस्पॉडिंग हमें क्या करना चाहिए तो आशीष जी सबसे पहले तो आप मुझे यह बताएं कि जैसे मैं कोई भी चीज खरीदने जा रहा हूं रियल एस्टेट से रिलेटेड तो वह काफी इन्फ्लेट है तो उसका क्या रीजन है और यह जो जंप देखने को मिला है एकदम तो इसके पीछे क्या रीजंस है क्यों जंप हुआ है ये देखो रीजन सबसे पहले समझना होगा हो तभी हम समझ पाएंगे कि यह जो आपको अप मूव देखने को मिला है रियल एस्टेट में पहले प्लॉट्स में था फिर उसके बाद फ्लैट में आया है तो ये कब तक रहेगा और कहां पर आपको करेक्शन देखने को मिल सकती है किस साल में देखो मैं अगर बात करूं 2012 में ऐसा बूम देखने को मिला था उसके बाद एक लंबी मंदी के बाद रियल एस्टेट में अब फिर से डिमांड आनी शुरू हुई है और वो हुई है कोरोना काल के बाद उसके पीछे दो ही रीजन थे कि लोग वर्क फॉर्म के चक्कर में वापस अपने घर चले गए थे सप्लाई बिल्कुल नहीं आई थी तो वापस ऑफिस का ओपन अप श होना शुरू हुआ है चाहे आप पुणे की बात करें चाहे आप मुंबई की बात करें बेंगलोर की बात करें या दिल्ली एनसीआर की बात करें लोगों ने वापिस से जवाइन किया है ऑफिस तो पहले रेंटल की डिमांड बड़ी थी रेंटल आसमान छू रहे हैं विने जी रेंटल के बाद लोगों ने कहा कि हमें अपना घर खरीदना चाहिए तो वहां से प्रॉपर्टी की डिमांड शुरू हुई पहले आपके प्लॉट बढ़े उसके बाद फ्लैट में डिमांड आई तो एक रीजन था लोगों का वापस मेट्रो सिटीज में वापस आना पर छोटे सीरीज में भी छोटे शहरों में भी डिमांड आई है एग्रीकल्चर लैंड में भी डिमांड आई है उसका क्या रीजन था उसका रीजन था 2000 की नोटबंदी तो हुआ क्या एक दम से आपकी लिक्विडिटी मार्केट में सामने आई है बिल्कुल लोगों ने पैसा खर्च किया है 2000 नोटबंदी के बाद तो जो पैसा बाहर निकला है बैंकिंग सिस्टम में तो फाइनली गया है जो कि हम डाटा में भी देख पा रहे हैं मुझे ऐसा लगता है पर वो मल्टीपल हाथों से गया है बैंकिंग सिस्टम में तो पहले जब वो पैसा आया तो जमीन लोगों ने खरीदी अगर हम एग्रीकल्चर लैंड की बात करें प्लॉट खरीदे तो वहां से फर्द लिक्विडिटी डिमांड जनरेट हुई आगे उसको इन्वेस्ट करने की तो वो बड़े शहरों से छोटे शहरों की तरफ भी रुख हुआ जमीन की अगर हम बात करें तो वो रीजन था नोटबंदी और लोगों का घर वापस आना तो यह एक और काफी समय से सप्लाई ना आना और एक सेंटीमेंट आपके जो थे इन सब न्यूज के वजह से सुधरे हैं और लोगों को लगने लगा है कि अगर मैंने आज घर नहीं खरीदा आज प्लॉट नहीं खरीदा तो फ्यूचर में तो पता नहीं क्या होगा फ्यूचर में पता नहीं कितना ज्यादा रेट होगा तो इस वजह से आपको रियल सेक्टर में एकदम से बूम आते हुए देखने को मिला है और नए नए डेवलपर्स भी सामने आए जैसे 2012 में भी आए थे विन जी नए नए डेवलपर्स अब आपको सामने आते हुए देखने को मिलेंगे जो कि नए लॉन्च लेक आएंगे बेहिसाब प्राइस प भी होंगे तो आपको अवेयरनेस और रिस्क कॉशस अप्रोच भी अपनानी है वो भी आपके लिए इंपोर्टेंट रहेगा जी तो आशीष जीब मेरे को फॉर एग्जांपल जैसे 2024 आ ही रहा है तो मुझे प्लॉट की तरफ जाना चाहिए या फिर फ्लैट की तरफ जाना चाहिए फ्लैट्स की अवेलेबिलिटी तो काफी होती है बट फ्लैट्स बहुत ज्यादा हैं तो आपकी नजर में फ्लैट वर्सेस प्लॉट अगर हम बात करूं तो आपकी कौन सा ज्यादा मुझे रिटर्न दे सकता है देखो जमीन कम हो रही है विनय जी सब जगह पर चाहे मेट्रो सिटीज की बात कर लो या छोटे शहरों में बात कर लो पहले छोटे शहरों की बात कर लेते हैं जो कि टायर टू टायर सिटी रहती है लुधियाना की बात करें या हरियाणा के कुछ पर्टिकुलर सिटीज की बात करें साउथ में किसी पर्टिकुलर सिटी की बात करें अभी तो सब जगह पर बूम था मुझे लगता है कि वहां पर ये खत्म हो चुका है और ज्यादा मेरे को प्राइज एस्केलेशन की उम्मीद नहीं है क्योंकि छोटे शहरों में ऐसा नहीं है कि विन जी लोगों के पास बाइंग कैपेसिटी बहुत ज्यादा हो आप क्या अनुमान लगाते कि छोटे शहरों में दो करोड़ तीन करोड़ चार करोड़ से ऊपर क्या कोई प्लॉट खरीदेगा या घर खरीदेगा तो मुझे लगता और वहां पर लोन की अगर हम बात करें फाइनली कुछ लोग लोन प भी घर खरीदते हैं तो उनकी सिविल स्कोर को भी अगर आप देखो उनकी टोटल इनकम को भी देखो तो मुझे लगता है कि वो पोटेंशियल उनका खत्म हो चुका होगा तो वहां पर अभी आपको थोड़ा ठंडा माहौल भी देखने को मिल रहा होगा और नए फर्द हाईक प्राइस में नहीं देखने को मिले हो और वहां पर ज्यादातर लोग प्लॉट में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं फ्लैट में नहीं करते हैं तो वहां पर मुझे थोड़ी रिकव देखने को मिलती है तो वहां पर तो मैं कहूंगा कहीं भीभी इन्वेस्ट ना करें एक कहा भी जाता है कि बाय व्हेन पीपल आर इन फियर और सेल व्हेन पीपल आर इन ग्रीड तो जब लालच का माहौल होता है कि मैं छूट जाऊंगा तो उस समय पर तो आपको चीजें बेचनी चाहिए और जब कोई नहीं खरीद रहा होता है तो वही समय होता है पैसा वही लोग बनाते हैं जो कि डर के माहौल में अपना इन्वेस्टमेंट करते हैं जब कोविड के टाइम प कोई नहीं खरीद रहा था जिन जिन्होंने इन्वेस्टमेंट की चाहे इक्विटी में की हो चाहे रियल एस्टेट में की होगी आज वो अच्छा प्रॉफिट कमा के बैठे हैं यहां से कोई खरीदेगा तो पता नहीं कि कितना प्रॉफिट कमाए प्लॉट की अगर हम बात करें विने जी प्लॉट का सिर्फ और सिर्फ एक ही ट्रिगर है एनसीआर रीजन की अगर मैं बात करूं हरियाणा की स्पेसिफिकली बात करूं या गुड़गांव की बात करूं तो अभी प्लॉट के ऊपर फोर्थ फ्लोर को बैन किया गया है ऐसा अनुमान लगाया जा रहा है कि जहां पर भी सड़क की लेंथ 9 मीटर है या पुराने सेक्टर है 12 मीटर है वहां पर शायद आपका फोर्थ फ्लोर ना आए दिन दियाल में तो चांसेस कम लगते हैं पर हां जहां पर प्लॉट का लोकेशन 24 मीटर रोड प है या बड़ी रोड के ऊपर है बड़ा साइज का प्लॉट है 250 स्क्वा यार्ड से ज्यादा है तो प्लॉट आपके लिए हमेशा इन्वेस्टमेंट पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से बेटर रहता है तो प्लॉट आपके कम भी हो रहे हैं या नए लॉन्च नहीं हो रहे हैं तो इन्वेस्टमेंट पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से प्लॉट बेटर है और आपको खुद रहना है रहने के हिसाब से फ्लैट सबसे अच्छा रहता है क्योंकि वहां पर आप जो एमिटी आपको मिलती है तो उसका आप चुनाव करते हैं और माई वन कंस्ट्रक्शन अभी काफी ज्यादा पॉपुलर हो रही है तो नया अगर आपको इन्वेस्टमेंट करना है नए घर में अगर आपको कंस्ट्रक्शन लिंक प्लान के साथ जाना है तो मावन कंस्ट्रक्शन में जाएंगे तो आपके लिए अच्छा रहेगा जी तो आशीष जी अब यहां पर बात कर लेते हैं कि जैसे यह मार्केट बूम कर रही है रियल स्टेट की क्या यह कुछ महीने रह सकती है क्या यहां पर फसने के चांसेस है या क्या यह हाउसिंग बबल की तरह ट्रीट किया जाए कि हाउसिंग मार्केट क्रैश हो सकती है यहां पे तो और कई कई लोग ऐसे सोचते हैं कि मार्केट बूम कर रही है मैं इन्वेस्ट कर दूं बट वही 2015 2016 की हालत ना हो जाए कि मार्केट बिल्कुल एकदम बिल्कुल कोई लेने को तैयार नहीं था तो उस केस में आपकी क्या र रहेगी कि क्या यहां पे हाउसिंग करेक्शन देखने को मिल सकती है बिल्कुल देखने को मिलती है विनय जी ये डर का माहौल अभी नहीं है लोग अभी फियर ऑफ मिसिंग आउट के चक्कर में या शॉर्ट टर्म में प्रॉफिट कमाने के चक्कर में लोग इन्वेस्ट कर रहे हैं और एक दिन में ही अगर आप देखेंगे पूरे के पूरे फ्लैट बिक जाते हैं पर ये एक खतरे की घंटी भी है दो जो 2012 में ऐसा बूम देखने को मिला था वैसा मुझे लगता है कि अगले छ महीने 9 महीने रह सकता है बट उसके बाद हो क्या रहा है विन जी ये समझना है काफी लोग फ्लैट लॉन्च कर रहे हैं अभी आप 10 पर दो बाकी आप पोजीशन पे देना अभी आप 30 पर दो बाकी आप सुपर स्ट्रक्चर के टाइम पे देना तो लोगों को यह मतलब नहीं है कि हम बाद में पैसा कब लेके आएंगे लोग क्या कर रहे हैं अभी 30 पर अपना पैसा दे रहे हैं और सोच रहे हैं कि बाद में जब प्रीमियम आएगा उसको बेच के निकल जाएंगे हो सकता है कुछ लोग ऐसा पैसा बना भी ले बट फाइनली जब एंड यूजर की मार्केट आएगी जब ये फियर ऑफ मिसिंग आउट का माहौल खत्म होगा या जब इनकी नेक्स्ट इंस्टॉलमेंट आएगी सुपरस्ट्रक्चर जो कि मुझे लगता है कि दो साल अभी दूर है दो साल के बाद जब वो सिचुएशन आएगी जब दोबारा बिल्डर पैसा मांगेगा उस समय लोग सप्लाई लेके आएंगे कि मेरा मुझे प्रीमियम आपको एग्जांपल देता रीजन गुरुगांव का एक प्रोजेक्ट था डीएलएफ का ही डीफ अल्मा वहां पर लंचिंग काफी अच्छे प्राइस प हुई थी 9500 के आसपास के हुई थी लोगों ने भर भर के पैसा लगाया था और बाद में वो डिस्काउंट पर भी की थी क्योंकि जब इशू आने शुरू हुए इंस्टॉलमेंट आनी शुरू हुई तो लोगों के पास पैसा नहीं आपको क्या लगता है विने जी 4 करोड़ 5 करोड़ के जिस तरीके से फ्लैट बिक रहे हैं आपको क्या लगता है कि लोगों के पास इतनी लोन की कैपेसिटी है या उनके पास वाइट मनी इतनी है जो वो दे पाएंगे हो सकता है कि एनआरआई जो बाय कर रहे हैं वो उतना सप्लाई कर पाए पर फाइनली एंड यूजर की इसको मार्केट को बनना है इन्वेस्टर्स को बाहर आना है और जब ये नेक्स्ट इंस्टॉलमेंट आएगी सुपरस्ट्रक्चर की कंप्लीट होने की या नेक्स्ट आपके पास जब जेब से 60 पर पैसा जाएगा तो लोग उसको बेचने निकलेंगे और जब सप्लाई आएगी तो बिल्कुल यहां से करेक्शन देखने को मिलेगी जिस तरीके से प्राइस बढ़ रहे है हां कुछ बेल्ट में हो सकता है आपको फायदा हो अभी नया एयरपोर्ट खुला है ग्रेटर नोडा में तो वहां पर एक प्राइस बूम समझ आता है द्वारका एक्सप्रेसवे बड़ा है वहां पर एक प्राइस एप्रिसिएशन समझ आता है पर 20000 के भाव पर मुझे समझ नहीं आता पर स्क्वायर फीट प हां 10000 का जिस सिचुएशन से मार्केट चल रही है वो एक रीजनेबल प्राइस मुझे दिखता है अयोध्या में प्रॉपर्टी के प्राइस बड़े वो समझ आता है पर कितना बढ़ेगा कितना प्राइस एक एप्रोप्राइटिंग आने वाला है 2024 में नहीं पर 2025 में तो मुझे दिखता है क्रैश रियल एस्टेट सेक्टर में तो कोशिस अप्रोच अपनाए एंड यूजर फाइनली फंस जाते हैं अभी ये इन्वेस्टर मार्केट है यहां पर रोज वो प्राइस बढ़ा रहे हैं सोच रहे हैं कि आज मैं थोड़ा पैसा डालूं और वहां से अपना रेट ऑफ रिटर्न जो है जो आरओ आई की बात करें हम तो वो वो उनको ज्यादा अच्छा दिखता है कम पैसा लगा के बट जब डिमांड आएगी उसके बाद यहां पर बिल्कुल आपको करेक्शन देखने को मिलेगी तो कॉशस अप्रोच लगाए किस पर्पस के लिए आप इन्वेस्ट कर रहे हैं अगर आप एंड यूजर है तो एंड यूजर के हिसाब से अपना घर खरीदें एक घर खरीदें फ्लैट की अगर हम बात करें बाकी इन्वेस्टमेंट के बिने जी बहुत सारे हरिजन है आपके लिए क्यों इतना रिस्क लेना है बड़े अमाउंट का रिस्क लेना है बाकी आप धीरे-धीरे अपना बाकी हरिजन में अपना इन्वेस्टमेंट कर सकते हैं अब जाते जाते बात करते हैं कि अगर मैं हील स्टेशन की बात करूं वहां पर भी काफी ज्यादा इन्वेस्टमेंट्स देखने को मिली है तो आपकी क्या राय रहेगी कि वहां पर इन्वेस्टमेंट करना कितना सही रहेगा देखो वहां पर लोगों का बिल्कुल बकल रुझान बड़ा है और जिस तरीके से ग्लोबल वार्मिंग हो रही है और एनसीआर रीजन की अगर मैं विन जी बात करूं जिस तरीके से पोल्यूशन है तो बिल्कुल हील स्टेशन के पास आप प्रॉपर्टी में इन्वेस्ट कर सकते हैं काफी लोग वहां पर अट्रैक्ट भी हो रहे हैं वहां पर आपको अच्छा मुनाफा हो सकता है पर ध्यान क्या रखना है वहां पर कुछ ऐसी जमीन भी होती है जो कि थोड़ा सा नीचे की तरफ है या पहाड़ खिसक जाते हैं तो वो आप थोड़ा सा ध्यान ले वहां पर अगर आपका कोई लोकल रिलेटिव या फ्रेंड है उसी से समझे कि किस जगह पर ऐसा ना हो कि आप बिल्कुल पहाड़ पे लैंड खरीद ले जैसे जोशी मट की बात करें या कुछ जगह पर लैंड स्लाइड भी देखने को मिली है या जमीन खिसक रही है तो ध्यान रखें कि हिल स्टेशन में आप कहां बाय कर रहे हैं देहरादून एक अच्छी अपॉर्चुनिटी है क्योंकि वो थोड़ा सा फ्लैट प आपका आ जाता है बाकी बिल्कुल मेजर हिल स्टेशन प लेने से बचे और आपको ये भी देखना है हिल स्टेशन प अगर आप रहने भी जाते हैं तो वहां पर एमिटी क्या मिल रही है हॉस्पिटल्स भी है कि नहीं है वहां पे अच्छे स्कूल है कि नहीं है क्योंकि देहरादून का मैंने एग्जांपल क्यों दिया वहां पर अच्छे स्कूल्स भी है हॉस्पिटल्स भी है तो वहां पर और दिल्ली देहरादून की काफी अच्छी सिक्स ले हाईवे बनने वाला है तो वो कनेक्टिविटी आपकी अच्छी होने वाली है तो देख और सोच समझ के करें अ लैंड का बिल्कुल देखें कि किस तरह की आप लैंड खरीद रहे हैं रियल एस्टेट प्लॉट तो बिल्कुल विन जी ओवर ए लॉन्ग टर्म आपको अच्छा रिटर्न बिल्कुल देता है तो इन्वेस्टमेंट के लिए प्लॉट में ही इन्वेस्ट करें वो ज्यादा अच्छा रहता है",
