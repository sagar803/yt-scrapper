      "string": "Where do we get our dreams from? Our dreams. Do we go after as men what we were denied as children? That which we didn't get as children, do we go after that after growing up? -Hello?\n-Hello, Chauhan? Tell Pandit Ji that I will be\nthere in 15 minutes. Bro, he has enquired twice\nabout where Prashant is. F**k, man. My boss called\nfor a random meeting. -Tell him that I will be there\nin 10 minutes. Thank you. -Bro. Or are we born with our dreams which stay within our hearts? And sometimes, they call out to us. Our dreams tell us to let them live. And in return, they promise us an adventure of a lifetime. A scary but a glorious adventure. Hold up. Look at him, bro. How else? Just look at him. Yo, bro. Bye. -Bye.\n-Bye. Hey, fear isn't completely useless. If it was so, humans wouldn't\nrun after seeing a lion. He would have stood still and\nthen the lion would have eaten him up. But fear saves him by indicating him\nto escape. But, Major sir, where does\nfear come from? And it gets instilled within\nas if settling in a home. Let's pause for a while. -Amazing ride. He was the fun part.\n-Excuse me. No way. -Again?\n-He is the remix, huh? You. And you, there. Why were you pointing fingers at me? -Why were you pointing fingers at me?\n-Bro, chill. You don't have to be so serious\nabout it. They were only having fun. Fun? -Yeah.\n-Yeah. Okay. Look, I am not serious either. I am just asking for\nmy personal feedback. Didn't you like my face? Didn't you like my car? Didn't you like my song? I mean, what can I improve? Actually, I feel all of the above. And since you are standing so close\nto me, please use perfume because\nyou smell just like my driver. -Oh, shit.\n-Oh God. That was brutal, Navya. -Yeah.\n-Yeah. -Thank you.\n-Chill. Bro, where do these kinds of people\ncome from? One second. I wanted to ask\none last thing. Prashant, who gets to play\nthe protagonist in a drama? Someone talented to play the part. He is Samarth. It's his first day\nat Satyanweshi. He has been playing the main characters\nin his English theatre. He is willing to play a small part\nin our act now. Because he wants to experience\nthe stage for a Hindi act. Samarth, why were you chosen\nfor the main roles in those plays? Pandit Ji, it's talent, yes. But I think the most important\nis discipline. I mean discipline and surrender. For one's part and the play as a whole. Talent is a waste if those qualities\nare missing. Pandit Ji, there is nothing more\nimportant to me than this part. -My job is a little unpredictable.\n-Then quit your job. If the role of the main character\nis so important to you, then... Pandit Ji, I have done full-time\ntheatre with you for two years. And now, you know about my compulsion. Prashant, when the play will take place\non the stage, your compulsions won't be seen. What will the audience see? Only your acting and preparation. No. You must have been chosen for the main role in Imtiaz Ali's film. But you didn't do that role. Secondly, I am the Imtiaz Ali here. And I am telling you that you have\nto come on time from tomorrow. You can quit the job\nif that's a hindrance. Or you can quit the main role. Come on. Start reading again. Hey, fear isn't completely useless. If it was so, humans wouldn't\nrun after seeing a lion. He would have stood still. Do you know what this means? Bro, it's F**k you. And I will say it in Hindi for you.\nF**k yourself. Yes! F**k you. And once a F**k you is always a F**k you. No matter what do not take it back.\nIt's sacred. So, if I point a gun at you out of fury, -We are scared.\n-you should still say this. F**k you, Jimmy. Don't take it back. -Yeah.\n-Don't take it back. He won't take it back. -So.\n-F**k, bro. Chill. -Chill, bro.\n-Is it still a F**k you? -I am sorry, bro.\n-Bro, calm down. I say this to you now. F**k you. All right. In your dad's car with the pocket money\ngiven by your mom, you learn a few English songs\nand puke after drinking only two beers, you rich F**ktards, F**k all of you. Sister, the smell that you get\nfrom your driver, your dad must have that too. It's the smell of adrenaline.\nHardworking men smell of that. You roam around with soft boys\nwho wear sweet perfumes and judge me, Ananya Pandey\nfrom North Campus, F**k you. And now, the most important thing. If the father of any of you\nturns out to be a police commissioner or a big politician or a big businessman, if he gets me caught and asks me\nto apologise, I won't apologise. I would still say F**k you. What can I do? A real man can't go back on his words. Calm down, bro.\nWe don't need to do this. All of you bought expensive shoes,\nclothes and cars. Their shopping spree never ends. Yet, all of them are cowards. They couldn't F**king find the courage in any of the malls. Oh shit. But the question remains the same. Where did these dreams come from? You gave us dreams, God.\nNow, what do you want from us? What do I want? Asks God. -Is it true that he was offered a lead\nin Imtiaz Ali's film? -I made dreams When I thought about turning humans\ninto Gods... -That's what we heard.\n-Why didn't he do it then? It's destiny, bro. If someone has a good destiny, he enjoys his life. When someone's destiny is bad,\nhe suffers immensely. He suffered. Wherever dreams come from, whatever reasons they come for, no matter if it's science or divine,\nonce they are planted in our hearts, they become the master and we become\nthe follower. The dream is the master. And we are the servants in the service\nof a dream. And everyone and everything\nthat stands between us is our enemy. And then the dreams vs. everyone. 'School Hall Of Fame' Bro, listen to this. The same case\nwas registered in Noida as well. A broker was giving the key to the\napartment to couples on an hourly basis. He was caught when the boy\ntook the girl to the apartment and he turned out to be the son\nof the owner. The broker was thrashed badly. Bro, don't get inspired by this.\nYour incentive is anyway low. Well, people on a notice period\nare giving lectures now. Get back to work now. 'Pandit Ji - Entry to the rehearsal\nwon't be allowed after 7pm today.' Prashant. Did you join the marketing team? No, sir. Are you still in sales? Okay. -Arpit?\n-Yes, sir. You joined the marketing team, right? -No, sir.\n-No? Hey, Garve. -Marketing team, right? No?\n-No, sir. Okay. Sir, I was making the PPT for\nthe builder client. I am just leaving. F**kers, I am tired of saying this. The sales team shouldn't\nbe in the office after 10am. You should be out\nin the fields, selling. I will fire the one who is still here\nafter three seconds. -What is it? -I wanted to talk\nto you for two minutes. It will be done by the time\nyou finish smoking a cigarette. I will smoke while shitting. Do you want to talk to me? Sir, you can get done with it\nand then... What after that? Go and talk to the client now. You will find me in the office after 6pm\nif you want to talk to me. Sir, I wanted to talk about\nthe evening... -What is it?\n-Sir. -You can smoke. I will tell you what\nI want while standing outside. -What? Brother. Brother. Uncle, I can hear you. Your uncle built a floor in sector 12. He gave me the responsibility\nof selling it. The price of the floor was 1.3 crore\nwhich was 10 lacs more than the market. But that's okay. I thought I would sell it.\nFor three months, I worked very F**king hard. I presented the client with\nmaterial, woodwork, the science of architecture\nand everything else and sold three floors.\nAnd now, we are left with the fourth which is the last floor. The client was going to\ncome in the afternoon today to make the advance payment. Do you know what your uncle\nsaid last night? It's been three months since I didn't\nsell the flat. The price has increased. The rate is 1.4 crore now. Tell me. What should I tell the client?\nTo pay 10 lacs more now? Am I asking for pubic hair? Anyone\ncan just pick them without a care. Oh, wow. I got 20 instead.\nI have extra. Keep it. Who is he, uncle? Him? He is Jatin.\nHe is my brother-in-law's son. He asked me to keep him along\nso that he could learn the job. Can we talk in front of him? Yes. We can. Don't tell anyone in the office\nthat Jimmy met us. Our boss, Kukreja, is Jimmy's uncle. They don't get along well.\nHe is evil like Uncle Kans. Got that? Don't tell anyone about it. Tell me. What do we have to do? Uncle Grover. I am upset with you. Bro, why are you upset with me now? You listed your old Mercedes\nonline to sell it. You didn't tell me about it. I told you about it. Jimmy, it's going to be 15 years old. You wouldn't have been able\nto drive it in NCR anyway. Uncle, I didn't want to drive it. I wanted to make someone jealous. Whom? I have two conditions, uncle.\nIf I get the deal done for you, then you will sell your car to me. And the second one is that\nyou want 50% commission, right? You can keep your commission\nto yourself. -I will take my commission\nfrom the client. -What? You will get your commission\nfrom the client? If you ask the client to pay 10 lacs\nmore, he would spit out scum. And you are saying that you will get\nyour commission from the client. Oh God. -Bro, pack a fresh piece of this.\n-Okay. -And the ones I selected before.\n-Okay, sir. Jatin, do you listen to rap? Yes, a little. Who am I? I am the goon who comes\nduring broad daylight. I steal without a stick or a knife. Selling a house is a farce, bitch.\nI think I have got a cheat code. Rabbit was quite fast.\nSo, you gave him that name. I sell quickly. So, call me Sales God. Let's start training you. Bro, why did buy so many formal clothes? Uncle, I will tell you in the evening\nwhen we party for getting the deal. With my second condition. -Bantu. Listen.\n-Yes, bro. I want furniture for a 3BHK. Within the range of 1.5 to 2 lacs. Listen. Everything should be unique. Nothing similar should be available\nin Delhi, NCR, to compare the rates. Start loading them in the truck.\nI am sending the address. Okay, bro. Our theatre is very reputed, sir. And we have a show in three weeks\nat a very big event. Sir, I have a reading at 7pm every day. So, sir... If there is a meeting in the evening\nat the office, so, I would request you to allow me to leave by 6:30pm max if it's a long meeting. That will be all, sir. I had a boss. Bharat Sai. He was married. Mrs. Sudha. His wife. She was very sweet. Very loyal. Very supportive.\nThe perfect wife. I found out that Sai has a fling outside. Do you understand what a fling is? An affair. He knew that I knew about it. One day, after a few drinks, I asked Sai sir, why does he have another woman? Then Sai said that\nwhenever he meets her, he feels the excitement. Which he doesn't feel in his marriage. Then I asked, Bharat sir, why don't you leave your wife and get married to her? The woman he has a fling with. And then Bharat sir said something. After that, I never had any confusion regarding the choices in life. Sai sir said, Shishir, if you try to turn the fling\ninto a marriage, she will be a bad wife. The thrill of the fling\nwill also be gone. Your passion for acting and job. Which one is your fling?\nAnd which one is your marriage? -Acting...\n-Acting is your fling. Right? If the other woman and your wife\nmake a plan together, apologise to the other woman. Never disappoint... -Your wife.\n-You got it. I have a few concerns\nabout your selling. Let's do this. Finish your meetings and come back to\nthe office. We will talk in the evening. At 7pm. He called you at 7pm at the office. What will you do now? I will go to the theatre. I will tell him that my car\nstopped working. But what was the point of talking\nto him? He now knows that I have a rehearsal\nat 7pm. He would call me to the office\nevery day at 7pm intentionally. But you at least told him what you want. It's essential. To be able to speak and speak up. It's okay. You will learn how\nto convince someone with time. No one cares about what\nsomeone else wants. Be it, your boss or family. -Everything thinks about themselves.\n-Hey, look here. It's getting inside you. The ghost of a dream. Get rid of it. Do it. Jugli jugli jhul jhula. Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. Greetings, mister. How are you? -Greetings, ma'am. Are you fine?\n-Greetings. Yes. -Wow. Such a nice kid.\n-Say hello to uncle. She has also come along.\nHave you come to see the house as well? Come to uncle. Let me lift you. Very good. I have brought something\nfor you. Shall I give it to you? Here you go. -Chocolate.\n-Wow. Who is this man? Him? He is my cousin. I told him that we have chosen\nthe apartment and we will make the advance payment\ntoday. That's why he also came along to cast\nhis eyes upon it. Cast an eye? Amazing. The relatives\ncome first to cast an eye when something good is going to happen. Cousin, I am just joking. You can cast an eye if you want. Just don't cast an evil eye. Please come, ma'am. Sir, come. Cousin,\ncome on. Let me show you the house. Look at this. The parking is downstairs. Two of your cars can be parked together. They look so excited now. When they find out that\nthe rate has increased by 10 lacs, all the excitement will be gone. Bro, the rate has been increased. We won't tell them that. Then? Let's suppose that you\ntook your father's car out. And got into an accident\nand incurred a loss of 20 thousand. When your dad finds out, he will thrash you badly. What should you tell your dad\nwhen you call him which will make your dad say that it's okay, son? You have come to see the house, right? Looks like someone else\nis also moving in. It seems so. Ma'am, have a look at the fridge\nas well. If you like it, we'll have it\ndelivered for you as well. Yes, we have to get them. -Bro, I would cry first.\n-Okay. And then I will apologise to my dad. Okay. And if I am your dad, I will slap you for hitting the car. And slap you again for crying. You are F**king 22 years old.\nShould you be crying? Tell me what I should say. -The stairs are so nice. Madam.\n-Yes. There is a theatre nearby\nif you want to go for a movie sometime. -Mr. Grover, the furniture is going to\nour flat. -Yes? You should call your dad and tell him that you hit his car. And two people died as a result. One of your hands is not working. The crowd beat you up badly\nand set your car on fire. The relatives of those who died\nare waiting with sticks to beat you up. Just say this.\nPlease save me, dad. Dad? Dad. If you say dad once more, your dad will suffer a cardiac arrest. But you will tell your dad that all this could have happened but didn't happen. You just hit the car\nand there is a loss of 15 thousand. Then your dad will call you a scoundrel. A scoundrel. Is this something to joke about? The car will be repaired. Are you fine? It's called perceptual contrast\nin English. And we say, get someone so scared initially\nthat he can bear anything later. We shouldn't say that the rate\nhas increased by 10 lacs. We have to portray that the flat has been\ndealt to someone else. The advance payment has been made\nby the new owner. The furniture has been placed. They have shifted to the flat already. You can live in the house of your dreams in your dreams. That's enough. It doesn't work\nlike that. Don't worry at all. It's our specialisation. Property deal audit\nwhich means catching fraud and if the property papers are genuine\nor not. The terms and conditions laid by them\nfor the payment. Are they fulfilling their commitment\ngiven to you? We will take care of everything\nfor 3,500 rupees only. Okay. We are going to pay\nthe advance tomorrow. Okay. This is our auditor, Vicky. He will accompany you. He will ensure that you get a fair deal. Is he really an auditor? A CA? Madam, when it comes to property deal fraud, there's no CA or CID to catch them. There's only E.I.D. Experience In Deceitfulness. And I have loads of it. I can sniff it out. Earlier, the owners used to give\nthe house keys to the guard. But some brokers have been\nmisusing vacant flats nowadays. So, now, they give keys\nto someone they trust. When I saw the news that\nsome broker used it for... -That's so shitty.\n-Right. -Greetings, uncle. Prashant from\nProperty Lords. -Greetings. -Hello, sir.\n-Hello. Thank you. The woodwork is already done. In fact, the kitchen has very\nhigh-quality woodwork. And how are the amenities here? Gym, grocery, pharmacy. -The gym is inside the building.\n-Okay. And for basic groceries like bread,\nmilk, and butter, there's a shop inside. For vegetables and pharmacy,\nthere's a market close by. -I see.\n-But most of them home deliver it too. Ishita! Ishita! -Shall I get some water?\n-Ishita. -Ishita, do you have the medicine\nin your bag? -Did she get dizzy? She has a low BP problem. Sir, I need a favour from you. Can you\nrun to the chemist for a medicine? Sure. -It'll take around 15-20 minutes.\n-No problem. She'll be fine till then. -Please get it. I'll send you the name.\n-Okay. Mr. Grover, what is all this? Mr. Atul, just give me two minutes.\nI'm calling Mr. Kukreja. I'm the sole seller of these flats. And\nhe sold the flat without my knowledge. -Give me 2 minutes. I'm talking to him.\n-But... Why are you getting upset? He's trying to sort this out. It took us so long to find\none decent house. Seems like we're not destined to own it. He gave a better offer? All right.\nBut at least you could have told me. I would have spoken to Mr. Atul and\nwe could have matched that offer. Uncle, where is his cousin? What? Is he still up there? Jimmy, that guy is a small-time actor. What if the cousin asks him something? He will screw up everything. And they will get suspicious. Uncle. -Can I have some water?\n-Water? Uncle, I'll go upstairs and check.\nYou handle these people here. Okay, fine. Let me know. Sir, I need a... One second. -Hello.\n-Sir, you haven't sent me the name yet. Yes. I've asked someone back home\nto send me a photo of the medicine. I'll send it to you\nas soon as I get it. Okay? I'm at the medical store.\nLet me know once you have it. Is ma'am all right? I'm waiting for the name. Uncle. How much white and how much cash? 1.37 crore. That's the total amount, uncle.\nHow much white and how much cash? What do you mean by that? I'm paying 1.37. What do you mean by\nhow much white and how much cash? It does, uncle. There's white money\nand then there's cash. That's what I am asking about. I already told you 1.37 in all. Why do you keep asking how much\nwhite and how much cash? Uncle. Caught you. Sorry, Mr. Atul.\nBut the deal is already done. Our offer was for 1.3 crore. And this gentleman sealed it for 1.37. Seven lacs more and\nhe cut a deal directly. And my commission... Mr. Kukreja saved on that too. So, we've lost the house? Actually, Mr. Kukreja was saying that the new owner who has bought this house, he isn't going to live here.\nThis is just for investment purposes. Can we have a word with him\nby any chance? We can surely try. But we'll have to re-negotiate\nthe price. Initially, I thought the owner must\nhave got a better deal. He must have sold it to someone else.\nIt's usual in our line of work. But then I sensed that there is some sham. Looks like you all are a team. Come in, bro. Come. Have a seat. So, where was I? Yes, the sham. Mr. Grover was already\non his way downstairs. So, it's obviously not possible that\nhe mustn't have known which floor the furniture was being\ntaken to. After all, he's the sole seller\nof all the flats here. He would have surely been\na little inquisitive. Right, bro? Then I wondered, why so much drama? Lugging all the furniture up\nand setting up a fake owner. Only to turn down my clients? You could have straight away said\nthat you've cancelled the plan to sell. Why all this drama then? All this drama only to re-negotiate. What do you mean by re-negotiate? 1.37 that he paid plus whatever commission he wants\nover and above that? Yes. I know it's more than what\nwe had decided. But, madam, there's no other way out. We can at least give it a try. Okay. Stop whining. Let me think. -Mr. Grover.\n-Yes. I'd like to discuss this with\nmy cousin once. Your client. You are not his cousin. Look, buddy, if you have a client, then so do we. Doesn't that make us business partners? My dear partner buddy, this epic tale that I've been narrating\nall this while, it certainly wasn't to enthral you. I could have straight away gone and\ntold them about the scam going on here. Fine then. How much? 'Hope you'll be at the theatre\non time today.' 'Yes. I'll be there before 7pm.' Hello. I just got the photo. It's\nMidodrine. Just get one packet. Okay? Okay. By the way, I was wondering how she is. My calculation is quite simple. Cut the mango and share it equally. Half of the total commission. This isn't fair, bro. It was anyway going\nto sell for 1.3 crore. How about this? Anything above 1.3, for whatever price it sells, half of that commission will be yours. Oh, really? Trying to act smart, are you?\nYou will get 2% of 1.3 crore which is 2.6 lacs. Say you sell it for ten lacs more, so half of 2% of 10 lacs\nis what I'll get? Ten thousand? Do I look like a fool to you? Sorry, bro. This is the last offer. Is that so? Who do you think you are? Your sham will be exposed. If I go down and tell them\nabout this shady scheme, your entire deal will go for a toss. And so will your 2.6 lacs commission. My share comes to 1.4 lacs. Only for you, let's\nfinalise it at one lac. No issues, bro. Go and tell them. All right then. Your wish. Let's make it 76,000. Sounds good? -Tell me.\n-Let me make it 10,000 with a dressing table. This one. It came extra\nwith the rest of the stuff. Now, you're taking this too far. -So, did you cast an eye?\n-Listen. Need to speak with you. Hello. Anyone there? Yes, sir. What are you exploring in there\nfor so long with the door locked? Your broker isn't here either. -What the hell are you doing in there?\n-Sir. Sir, please calm down. Mr. Prashant has gone out\nto get medicine. My wife fainted. Her BP dropped. -Fainted? Where is she? Let me see.\n-Sir, she is better now. She's fine. Better now? Hold on. Tell me something, son. Is she better now or\nhas she fainted now? -Sir, she fainted but she's better.\n-What happened? -Why are you here? Sit and relax.\n-No, no. It's okay. What's wrong here? What happened, uncle? Your medicine. Thank you. Thank you. Are you done seeing it?\nSo, are you leaving now or... Is she -going to sit and relax?\n-No, sir. We're done seeing. She'll have her medicine\nand then we'll leave. All right. Make it quick. Give me the keys. I'll turn off\nthe lights and lock the door. Come. Let's go. Take your medicine. -And let's go out and talk.\n-Sure. But, Vinay, you left your stuff inside the room. What? Oh, yes. I'll get it. Is it there where I left it? As I got off the bed, I think I stepped\non it and it went under the bed. I'll just go and get it. I'll take my medicine. I think\nI left the water downstairs. -What is it, son?\n-Nothing, sir. My wife was resting inside. She left\nsomething behind. I'll just get it. Did it go under the bed or what? Yes. But I'll get it out. No worries. Where is it? I will get it, uncle. No worries, uncle. I'll do it. I'll get it out, uncle. You let it be. But where is it? Jimmy, tell me something. He asked you for 1.4 lacs. And you offered him just 10,000\nand a dressing table. Why such a cheap offer? Because the guy seemed intelligent. And hence, I thought he might take the offer. If he was intelligent, why would\nhe take such a bad offer? If he's intelligent, he won't have\nhis eyes on my share. Rather, he will think about how much\nhe would lose if he refused. In English, it's called loss aversion. I call it being a dumbass. Jimmy, I don't get what you're saying. Son, don't try to learn too much\nin one day. Or you'll start choking. The deal is done. I'm happy. Mr. Grover told me about your demand. 1.4 is what we can pay at best. Sure. Please come in. Let's sit and talk. Come. He is one bastard for sure. I spent three months to earn\nmy commission of 2.8 lacs. And this dog swooped away a profit\nof 3.5 lacs in just one day. -The deal's done, sir.\n-Thank you. -Just one request.\n-Yes. -Yes.\n-This furniture that you see, I bought it for this house. And the plan was to sell\na fully furnished flat. Now that you have bought this house,\nthis furniture, -you'll have to buy it too.\n-Of course. Madam was planning anyway. -Isn't that right, madam?\n-Yes. -We do need to buy furniture.\n-No, no. We can't. Sir, we've already overshot the budget. We won't be able to afford it.\nIt's difficult. Atul, at least ask him the price. I bought it for five lacs.\nYou can pay me the same. What? Five lacs? Impossible. At best, we can buy one or two\nessential furniture. Please return the rest. -It should be fine.\n-Return? The person I bought it from\nis standing right here. Let's ask him if it is returnable\nor not. Is it returnable, sir? Sorry. -Not possible.\n-So, you were treating her low BP. You scoundrel. Is this how you were pumping her low BP? Just wait, you son of a... -Hello.\n-Sorry, sir. Sir, I'm calling from\nUltima Prime Society. Sir, we've nabbed that gang. The men who pose as brokers\nand let out rooms to couples. To indulge in indecent acts. Yes, sir. There's this boy named Prashant here. He's the broker. Sir, please come\nright away. Sir, please. Sorry.\nIt won't happen again, sir. Look at him. He is at least apologising. But this guy, he is so sly. He has been standing tight-lipped\nall along. How much do you charge for one time? Must be less than a hotel I'm sure. No wonder couples come to you. Uncle, I've already said this. I came here to show them the flat. And this madam pretended\nto have fainted. I was sent away to the pharmacy. And then they did it. -That's what I've been saying but...\n-Who is that guy? Who is letting out flats? You asshole. Bastard. We have our daughters\nliving here. How dare you dump filth in our society! You F**king bastard! Sir, their query had come directly\ninto our company's system. So, there's no chance our employee\nwas in cahoots with them. Although he shouldn't have left them\nalone in the flat. That was a mistake. They fooled him and he fell for it. What happened? Okay. Let it be. Let's do one thing. Siddharth, Manan, and Samarth, three of you prepare the monologue of\nthe main character in the 12th scene. The new lead actor will now be selected\namongst the three of you. -All right?\n-Yes, Pandit Ji. Come on. Let's proceed. Let's start the rehearsal. We've already\nwasted a lot of time. Let's start. Sir, this girl says that it was\ntheir plan. His company employee is innocent. My wife is calling. I'll be back. -Kaushal, get him out.\n-Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Bring the girl along. Madam. Here you go. Congratulations\non the Mercedes. It's all yours. Burn all the fuel\nyou want. I'll burn it tomorrow. I'll need kerosene, you see. What rubbish. Hey, Jimmy. If that girl would have lied that you were with them, our company's reputation would have got\nscrewed so badly, you have no idea. Tomorrow morning at 9, there'll be a meeting in the office\nwith the entire team. And in that meeting, I'll make sure\nyou regret this mistake. Good night. And listen. What they were saying that they slapped you\ndue to a misunderstanding, think of it as a tight slap from me. Because in this line of work\nwhere people dupe their clients, you're one of a kind who got duped by the client. It's not their fault. A bastard is only a bigger bastard when an asshole is a bigger asshole. And you are a dumbass, a big one. This is enough for today. I'll sleep well. But why did you do this? Uncle, my car, my wish. -Why are you getting stressed?\n-Fine. Now, here's my second condition. Have you heard of Property Lords? Yes. It's a big name in real estate. -It's your uncle's biggest competitor\ntill date. -Guess what? Hello, Rajkumar. We're glad to\noffer you the role of Sales Manager at our organisation. Please confirm your... -Acceptance of the offer.\n-Of the offer. Regards, Kavita. Some Rajkumar seems to have got a job\nat Property Lords. What am I supposed to do? -Uncle, listen to me carefully.\n-Okay. Rajkumar has got a job\nat Property Lords. Property Lords is your boss's, meaning my uncle, Mr. Kukreja's biggest -competitor.\n-Yes. Many wealthy buyers go to Mr. Kukreja. And Mr. Kukreja, the motherF**ker Kukreja, sells properties to those clients who are also listed with Property lords. All the information about those clients, you need to get it from\nKukreja and give it to Rajkumar. Rajkumar will sell the same property\nto those clients at a cheaper rate and steal the deals from Kukreja. Hold on. Why will I give him\nall the information from there? Because in return, Rajkumar will share his commission with you. Fifty-fifty. Now, -the most important thing.\n-Go on. Uncle, Rajkumar is -Jimmy.\n-Rajkumar is Jimmy. -Rajkumar?\n-That was my name in school. Hey. I'll call you when\nI burn it tomorrow. -I need a smashing video. We'll make\na reel. -Sure, Jimmy. Jimmy, your clothes. You're back. How was your rehearsal? It was good. I hope you told your boss not to keep\nyou at work when you have rehearsals. Yes. It's his father-in-law's company. Why would he care for the rehearsals?\nAll he will care about is work. He just has to request. Tell him frankly. People understand. He will also understand. -Just tell him.\n-I will. How is your health? Absolutely fine. I'll change and come. Some of my fellow soldiers\ngot killed today. Some more may get killed. But before they die, they will think about their dead dreams. Dreams. Where do dreams come from? Okay. So, now, all you children will tell me\nyour name one by one. And what you do aspire to be\nwhen you grow up? Okay. Let's start with this boy who\nis struggling with his shoelace. Prashant, look up.\nSir is talking to you. Prashant. Look up.\nSir is talking to you. -Prashant. Sir is calling you.\n-Quiet, everyone. Looks like Prashant hasn't decided\nwhat he wants to become. But in the next class, we will\nask Prashant again. In fact, before every music class, you all must tell me what you\nwant to be when you grow up. -Sir, every time?\n-Yes, every time. Also, music class will only happen twice\na week, right? But every day, I want all of you to tell someone or the other what you aspire to be when you grow up. Your mother, your father, your siblings or your friends. And if they get irritated hearing it, then tell it to your dog or your cat. They will never get irritated. Sir, what if we don't have a dog or\na cat? Then tell it to your pencil,\nyour eraser, your milk mug, or best of all, to yourself. Standing in front of the mirror. But what's important is to say it\nevery single day. Because if you don't, then by the time you grow up, you might forget what your\naspirations were. And the moment you forget,\nothers will come and tell you what you should be. And you might even believe it. Because what you wished for, you no longer remember it. I, Prashant Narula, will be the best actor of all time.",

      "string": "Hello everyone and\nwelcome back to 5paisa. Imagine a world where\n everyone has a safe and affordable home. In India, in the last few years, the population and income\n have both increased. And because of this, \n the demand for housing is also increasing rapidly. According to the ACCC,\n or socio-economic and caste census, by 2011, there were \n 4 crore Indian households who did not have \na home and basic amenities. To deal with this problem, \n the Indian government launched The Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana \n on 1st June 2015. Under this scheme, the government\nwanted to build cost-effective homes and provide affordable housing to everyone. Also, by 2022, the government has \n set a goal to achieve housing for all. In fact, in the 2023 budget, PM Awas Yojana's budgetary allotment  has been increased from 66% to 79,000 crore. With this extra funding,\n the scheme is going to get a significant boost. But you can also take advantage of this when you have all the information \n about PM Awas Yojana. And in today's video, \n we have tried to do this. So, in this video, \n we will discuss what is the eligibility of PM Awas Yojana, what are the different categories \n of this scheme and how you can take advantage of it. Then we will see how you can apply \n for PM Awas Yojana through both online and offline. And at the end of the video,\n we will also discuss some tax benefits of the scheme. So, let's start this video\n with the basic question, what is Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana? PM Awas Yojana, in-short PMAY \n was launched to end the housing crisis in \n India's urban and rural areas. More than 3 crore houses \n have been built under this scheme. PM Awas Yojana is divided into two parts,\nPMAY Gramin and PMAY Urban. The main goal of PMAY Gramin is to replace rural houses with \n permanent houses and end the housing deficit. There is a plan to build \n 4 crore houses under this scheme. And in December 2021, the government \n extended this scheme to March 2024. In the PMAY Gramin scheme, it generally takes \n an average of 114 days to build one house.  According to this scheme, the size of the unit in \n Gramin is a minimum of 269 sq. ft. Now let's talk about the fund allocation. Here, both the center and \n the state shares the cost in the ratio of 60 to 40. This is about the plain areas. PM Awas Yojana, the price of \n Gramin is 1.2 lakh rupees per unit. Remote areas and the Himalayan states, Northeastern states and \n Jammu and Kashmir, the cost ratio is 90 to 10. And the price help for each unit is Rs.1.3 lakh. In the Union Territory, the center alone bears the entire cost. Now, how are the beneficiaries selected? Beneficiaries are decided \n on the basis of socio-economic and caste census. And after that, it is \n verified by the Gram Sabha. Now, if we talk about \n the PMAY Urban Scheme, it was introduced on June 25, 2015. In this initiative,\n the government's goal is to build 2 crore houses in \nthe metropolitan areas of India. From July 2023, more than 119 lakhs \n houses have been sanctioned. The completion date of the Urban Scheme \n has also been extended from 31st March 2022 to \n 31st December 2024. Now, for beneficiary eligibility, Urban and Gramin have the same requirement \n in both the PS Awas Yojanas. First of all, the applicant \n should not already have a permanent house in the name \n of the applicant or the family member. But if someone has \n a 21 square meters permanent house that they want to improve, then in such cases, \n you can definitely apply under the PMAY Scheme. Regardless of marital status,  adults who are the wage earners \n in the household are eligible for all schemes. And in the case of a married couple, if one of the spouses also meets \n the requirement of family income eligibility, then that couple can apply \n for a single residence in joint ownership. Now, let's understand the different \n categories of the PM Awas Yojana. The first one is the EWS category, meaning economically weaker section, in which people with \n an annual income of 3 lakh rupees can apply. Where they are given a 6.5 % interest subsidy\n on a loan of up to 6 lakh rupees. Similarly, in the LIG category, i.e. the lower income group category, applicants are eligible for a \n 6.5 % interest subsidy on a loan of up to 6 lakh rupees. But in this category,\n the income of the applicant is between 3 lakh rupees to 6 lakh rupees. In the PM Awas Yojana, the third category is the MIG-1 or\n Middle Income Group-1 category, where if the applicant's income is between 6 lakh rupees to 12 lakh rupees, then they can get a 4% interest subsidy on a loan of up to 9 lakh rupees. In the PMAY category, \n the last category is the MIG-2 or \n Middle Income Group-2 category, where only those people can apply whose annual income varies\n between 12 lakh to 18 lakh rupees. And such applicants are eligible for a loan of up to 12 lakh rupees \n and a 3% interest subsidy. In the different categories of \n the PM Awas Yojana, the interest subsidy and loan amount vary. Along with that, the carpet area is also different \n for the applicants of these categories. In the government regulations,\n the net usable floor area  of the apartment\n is called the carpet area. So, for the beneficiaries\n of the EWS and LIG categories, this carpet area is \n in the range of 30-60 square meters. For the MIG-1 and MIG-2 applicants, the carpet area of the house \n is 160 square meters and 200 square meters respectively. Now, the Housing for All initiative\n of the PM Awas Yojana government made four \n schematic verticals to deliver it. The first is the Institute \n Slum Redevelopment i.e. ISSR, in which the qualified \n slum inhabitants are provided with rehabilitation facilities\n with the help of private investment. And for this, a grant \n of 1 lakh rupees is also given. The second vertical of the PM Awas is the Credit Link Subsidy Scheme i.e. CLSS. And under this scheme,\nfor new home buildings and refurbishments, 6 lakhs to 12 lakhs rupees \n or low interest home loans are offered on the central subsidy. The third vertical is Affordable Housing \n in Partnership i.e. AHP Here, state governments are given \n central funding of 1.5 lakh rupees. And it is said that they should \n provide affordable housing to the EWS category i.e.\n economically weaker section. by partnering with private sector or federal agencies The last vertical of the\n PM Awas Yojana is  Beneficiary-led Individual \n House Construction Enhancement i.e. BLC. Even in this, government provides \n Rs.1.5 lakh to the EWS applicants so that they can build \n their own home or improve their existing home. Now, no matter what category \n the applicant belongs to,  the process of applying \n for the PM Awas Yojana is the same for both online and offline. If we talk about the online process, first of all, you have to \n visit the PM Awas portal i.e. pmaymis.gov.in. On the home page of the site, you will see a button \n for citizen assessment. Under that, you have to click \n the Apply Online link. After that, you have to \n select one of the four verticals and submit the application. If you are applying for CLSS vertical, then your home loan lender will receive \n your application in a short time. If we talk about the offline \n process of the PM Awas Yojana, first of all, you have to \n visit your nearby Common Service Center. From there, you have to \n buy your relevant subsidy form for which you have to pay \n a minimum fee of 25 rupees plus GST. After that, you have to complete this form and submit it to the same center. To check the status of the application form, simply log in to \n the same portal of the PM Awas Yojana, pmaymis.gov.in. And then you can check \n the status of your firm by going to the Track Application option. But this will only happen when you \n follow the prompts of the portal properly In the PM Awas Yojana,\n you can receive tax benefits under the following sections of \n the Income Tax Act of 1961. For example, under Section 80C, you can deduct 1.5 lakh rupees annually from the principal of your home loan. Second, in Section 24B, \n you can also deduct up to 2 lakh rupees from \n the home loan interest payment. And if you are a homebuyer \n for the first time, then under Section 80EE, you are eligible for \n an annual tax break of up to 50,000 rupees. Similarly, applicants \n who are first-time buyers and whose house comes under \n the affordable housing category, under Section 80EEA, they can also claim an annual deduction \n of up to 1.5 lakh rupees on their home loan interest payment. So, that was all about \n the PM Awas Yojana. If you want to know more about \n such schemes, then do let us know \n in the comment section. And do like and subscribe to our channel. See you in our next video. Thank you.",

      "string": "How to become rich from real estate? I personally believe that real millionaires are from real estate. Now why am I saying this? There is a big logic behind it. See, I said that real millionaires are from real estate. It means that you can say that I want to say that only those people are making money in real estate and money is not being made in the other field. It is not like that. You will also see millionaires in other fields. But I personally believe that a person who starts earning money at a time, after that money starts coming, he definitely invests his money in real estate. So most of the rich people that you will see, whether they have become rich from any profession, any industry, they have definitely invested their money in real estate. The second thing is why is this a real investment? I will also talk about this. Because if a person today is rich from any other business, in fact from stocks or crypto, it is not that he is not rich there. That is also money, that is also real money. But it can be very fluctuating. Today, the value of shares may be very high and tomorrow it may fall drastically. But in real estate, drastic fall downs are less. That is why I gave the biggest statement here that real millionaires are made from real estate. Now today we will discuss two scenarios. The number one scenario is that you want to earn money from real estate, that is why you have come to this video. So either you will have money. So if you have money, one scenario may be that you have money today and you want to invest that money, in fact you want to multiply it, that is why you are watching this video. Or it may be that you do not have money today. But it is your wish, it is your passion, it is your desire that I earn money from real estate and learn to earn money. So now I personally feel that most of our audience belong to a middle class background. And in middle class backgrounds, there is not a lot of money to invest in real estate. So either there is not a lot of money or there is no money. I will take this scenario first. So in this video, we will talk about two concepts. The first concept, as I said that you have money today, how can you become rich from real estate? And that concept will be more important for most people who do not have a lot of money today or do not have money. Why did I say a lot? Because when you talk about real estate investment, then money is needed for investment. If you have a few thousand or a few lakhs today, then you cannot do much in real estate. This is a reality. So you need big money to become an investor. But if you do not have money today, then we will discuss this scenario in detail and then we will talk about how to make money in real estate. So the scenario is clear that you do not have money, no money. And the second thing is that you have to earn money from real estate. Now see, when we discussed that drastically real estate price doesn't go down, I was very clear with one thing and I want to give you the clarity of what I am clear in my mind. I am telling you today. It is possible that what I am telling you exactly today will not work for you today. It is possible that after a few years you will understand these things and you will work on them. So when I talk about real estate, my first focus is on land. flats, apartments, villas, shops, we will talk about all this later. My first focus is on land. Why land? Today, look at India, our population, now The figures say that it has reached around 150 crores. 150 crores. 150 crores people live in India. Now there are 150 crores people in our country. Most of them are young population. Young population has some specialties. What are the specialties? That most of them will earn money and make money. And they have a lot of desires. One of the biggest desires is to buy their own house. Most of the 150 crores people are young population. And they are potential buyers of real estate. And real estate is always made on land. Land is a thing whose demand is still there. And in the coming time, the population will increase. They will get married, have children and the demand for land will continue. So the demand for land is not going to decrease. This is point number one. Its demand will not decrease. And if the demand increases, then the prices will also increase. So land is such a thing that you always have to listen to things. When your family is together in your house, then there is a topic. Do you know what is that topic? How did your grandfather lose his property, sold it, lost the land, or made a mistake at that time by selling it and today its price is this much. There must be such things somewhere that the place where it was, today its price is this much, it used to be ours. So losing land or selling land due to any economic condition is always a hot topic in families. There are very few people who have sold a piece of land and then bought a bigger one. And they are ultimately wealthy, which you are seeing today, so this is very important. So the top wealthy people of India, the top rich people, you will see one thing in common that they will have a lot of land, they will have a lot of land bank, they have a lot of land, and today you think how will we buy land, because it takes so much money, there are many such places in India, like if you talk about Mumbai or any big metropolitan city, buying land is a very big thing, because it has become so expensive. And in the coming time, whether the land increases or not, I am saying the first thing, whether it increases or not, because it takes time to multiply, but its price does not decrease. So there will be depreciation in very rare cases, there is no depreciation on land, because there is very little depreciation on land, that is why it has always been called a safe investment, and it has been called such an investment that if you want to be real wealthy, if you want to be a real millionaire, then you should have land. So although we talk a lot about the stock market, we talk about stocks, there are two types of assets, this is a real asset, that is a paper asset, both have their own value, both have their own advantages and disadvantages, now what is the advantage of stocks, that today you have bought 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 shares, which you cannot buy land from 50,000 in most places, but you have bought stocks of 50,000, if you ever want to sell it, then you can sell it in a day, money will come in your this thing is not possible so soon in land. Here, like we buy stocks, there is a bid, there is an ask, so the difference between bid and ask is that you will always get this difference in real estate in land, suppose a person wants to sell land for 10 crores and the person who wants to buy it wants to buy it for 9 crores, so there is a gap of 1 crore, now they come in between and negotiate somewhere, a deal was made in 9.5 crores, what we are saying, like I said about crores, see it is very easy to say. Now, you might find this video lengthy but I will teach you what I have to teach you today because my point today is that I am giving you this in clarity by watching one video in a day, you will not become rich but you will become rich by taking action on the steps I will give in this video And if you are interested in real estate, then it is very important to listen to these things and sit in your mind So my prime focus is on land, I have told you the reason, population will increase, second thing is safe investment and depreciation is equal to zero, you will always see depreciation Although you will see that land is doubling every 6 years in good places, in some places you will say sir, what are you saying, I have seen it double in 2 years Yes, there is a time, but it is possible that the rate of land may not increase for 4-5 years, but it is possible that after 5-6 years, after 7 years, it will double and jump So these prices depend on many factors, so it is not like stock market, but it is different, but you need to understand this as well Now we were talking that there is no money, sir, you are saying there is no money and we are talking about land, okay, so now I will go step by step Today you do not have money, I told you one thing that your prime focus should be on land prime focus. If this focus is clear then we will move ahead. Today a person does not have money but he wants to make money from real estate. Now you have to understand two ways to make money. The first way is that I have my own investment. And that money multiplied, it became double, triple, five times. This became a great thing. But now there is no money. When we can't invest, then this will not happen. Now comes, we have to earn money. From here comes the point, earn. So real estate is a very lucrative business. In my mind, in my perception, it is clear that real estate can become a very good business. Now how can a person do business? What to do? How to do? We don't know its steps. So now we will talk about step number one. When we are talking about a person who doesn't have money and he wants to make money from real estate. Number one step, get a job. You will say that you always talk about business, self-employment and you are telling me to do a job. Yes. Today there is no money. There can be no investment. So what can happen? Let's understand this. If you want to do business in real estate, then you have to take its experience before that. You have to understand this industry. Now if you go to someone to take coaching, then there are no coaching classes for this. There is no such institute that is giving you training on real estate business. So where will you get to learn from? Tell me this. And why will someone teach you? So the most crash course to learn, you can say, what you will get, you will get in a job. Even if you get a job of ₹ 10,000, but you have to do a job in real estate. Now where do you have to do the job? Let's understand this. Look, there are two segments here, we will understand both. One is that there will be a lot of real estate brokers around you. Brokers mean property dealers basically. Your accessibility is very easy with those dealers. Why is it easy? You can go and talk for a job. It's that simple. Today I agree that there is no money, no skills, but you have time, you have energy, you want to learn. Now go and talk. In fact, you can even say that I don't even need a salary. You will say, why will I work without it? Look, you understand this thing. If you want to learn, you have to pay for it. Even if you don't get money to learn, it will still work. Even then you are in profit. So how will you get money? I will tell you. So one step is that you go to the dealer and say that I want a job. Whether he gives you a job for 10,000, whether he gives you a job for 20,000, whether he gives you a job for 50,000, whether he doesn't give you money today. But you have to do the job. Along with the job, you have to focus on one thing that I should learn as soon as possible. Now most of the dealers will give you the first job, which I am telling you, that will be inventory management. Now what is this? Inventory in real estate, dealers call it inventory. What are the properties in the market? There are many things in the inventory. Land means plots, what are the plots that are sold, what are the flats or floors that are sold Or if people want to give them on rent, then what are the floors and flats that can be found for rent, what are the shops, so this comes in the inventory, which is going to be sold, people want to sell and want to buy, so you will be taught inventory management, number one thing and for this inventory, you may be sent to the field that you go to the field and Bring the number of the builders. Bring the contact number of the people who want to sell their property. So far, people think that a property dealer has opened a shop and there will be someone who wants to sell and someone who wants to buy. And he will mix the two and the brokerage will come. It's not that easy. So this inventory management is the first thing you learn when you go inside a job. If you learn this, you will meet people who already have real estate, property, who want to sell it on rent So, number one, what will be the benefit of this? Your network will be created When the number is being shared with you, then you are coming in contact with such people who are already rich because all these people are rich. A person who wants to give his house on rent is rich. A person who wants to sell plots is rich. All these people are rich and you didn't have rich people in the circle till now. So what is the number one benefit of this job that you will go in the circle of those people who are rich. So sir, there is a saying in English that you are the average of five people you spend your time with. Till now, you were in a middle class background where there are only talks about how to get a good job. They will never say that there is a good job because it is useless. We want a stable job. You see, states like Bihar, Jharkhand are only focused on government jobs, they don't care about anything else. It's a good thing that you are getting a stable job in the government, it's not a bad thing, but the point is that you have seen that there is money in it, you have heard it, you have not seen it yet, I will talk about it later, so what was the first benefit, your network was made, point number two, what is the benefit for you One month, two months, three months, six months later, you will do a transaction. On this transaction, your dealer or broker with whom you were working, who is dealing the property, will share some commission with you. So basically, it happens that there is a lot of standardization in this business. That commission is being charged. What is that commission charging? Generally, typically 1%, 2%. This is the commission. Like if you sell something worth 1 crore, then 1% commission from one side. So if the buyer and seller are of the same dealer, then he will take 1% from the buyer and 1% from the seller. So he will earn a commission of 2%. In the case of flats and floors, there is a commission of 2%. In the case of commercials, there is a commission of up to 5%. So this is a system of commissions. But even if they give you a commission of 5,000 rupees, If you got a job for 10,000 then you will earn 50% commission. But now we were not talking about earning. Now it will take time to earn. You understand what I am saying. Today your situation can be anything. Today you need money immediately at home. But money doesn't fall from the sky. It takes time. Today if someone says that I want to become an engineer then he will do B.Tech for 4 years. Are you ready to learn for 4 years? If not then leave this video here. Today you don't have money, you are not ready to learn, you are not ready to give time and you want to become rich. It is not possible. Today you don't have skills, you don't have talent. Who will give you money? Will you win a lottery or not? In today's time, youth is being misguided so much that celebrities are adding that you can do betting You will get money from betting It is a guarantee that even if it comes once, it will always come, it will go away from your life It won't go away, you will have to do some solid business or you will have to do a solid job So understand this today, what I am telling you, these are not just talks, these are steps in life These are the steps to become rich So you will earn commission on the third day This is the most important When will you get a transaction done? You will see money. I am writing this and this is the biggest point so far. A middle class man has never seen lakhs of crores of rupees in front of his eyes. But when real estate deals are done, See, whatever we say today, Dealing in cash is illegal. Not allowed. But this is a fact that even today there are many places in India where there are real estate deals. Very small amount is given by cheque and most of the amount is given in cash. In your childhood, you must have seen it on TV that money goes in a bag, here you will get to see it and this is the reality, I will make all the things real, we are not talking about the paper In India, there is a lot of focus on transactions through cheques, but have you seen a cheque of 1 crore, tell me the truth, have you seen a cheque of 1 crore signed When there is a credit in the account and the other party says that 1 crore has come, have you ever heard that, if you have not heard it, then from where will you get to hear it, in which business will you get to hear it It will be a very clear thing, because I have seen these things very closely in life, what I would like to tell you, listen very carefully The girl whom you have not seen, how did she come to your mind? The girl you have not seen, how will you have the desire to get her, you have not seen her, you see a girl in college, you feel like getting married to her, become my girlfriend, this is the reality, we are not talking about anything like this, this is how it happens, so today my wife, she was my girlfriend, I had seen her in college, if I had not seen her, I would never have been married, I would never have thought about it, when I saw her, her level was much higher than mine, My level was nothing. But I had to raise my level. Same it will happen with money also. When you see money, you will hear that a deal of 50 lakhs has been made, a deal of 1 crore has been made, a deal of 5 crores has been made. If you haven't heard it, I am telling you now. These things must be looking like nonsense. But when there will be a transaction through you in reality, your mindset will jump. That it is possible. Because today you talk to me at home. Let's say I will earn 1 crore rupees or I will make a deal of 1 crore rupees. So middle class families will say, come to the land, don't think too much. You are not here. You started from a job. You made a network. You made connections. The deal was done. Two rich people, some had money and some needed something. You made them meet. You saw the deal happening. You saw the money in front of your eyes. So you went here. And when you went here, you saw the girl. You will miss her. You will want to get her. And one day you will get her. But if you didn't see the money, how will you get that money? So you need to see money. It is a very important step. Very very important step. Now when you will see money, you will have confidence to make another deal. And how many changes will you get by making this one deal? How many changes will come? I am taking an example of 1 crore rupees because there are more transactions than this and there are less transactions than this. Suppose there is a transaction of 1 crore, you see around you, there is a property of 1 crore, you have a lot more than this, so we are taking an example of 1 crore, so if there is a deal of 1 crore, and you got it done, then you must have some skills in you that the other person had 1 crore rupees and he trusted you that this man will get me the right thing for 1 crore rupees then you must have groomed yourself, so here the fourth which is the biggest thing in you, you will be groomed, so it is very important to be groomed, your skills will be enhanced Now if you have done 1 deal, after some time you will do 2 or 3 deals, it is possible that in a year you will do only 1 or 2 deals, but you think how much effort you must have done for that, how much inventory you must have seen, how many people you must have talked to, how many meetings you must have done Sir, I can tell you that you will get changes from every meeting, from every person, in your confidence, in the way you talk, in the way you make relationships, in your dressing style, there be changes in everything, as you will see people Now the person who is actually rich, if he stands in front of you in a normal T-shirt and jeans, then you will get a feeling that he is rich, so what is it that makes him feel rich, and you are getting to know that he has money, so the person who has money, the person who is actually a real estate millionaire, real estate millionaire, there is no air in real estate, see what it is, in India millionaire, what does millionaire mean, if we talk about Indian currency then it is only 10 lakh rupees And if we talk about the dollar, then if you take the dollar at today's rate of 80 rupees, then it is 8 crore rupees, so a person with 8 crore rupees in India, you can call him rich, but it is not too rich, because here you will see such people, who will have such properties that are more than 100 crore rupees, and you will see those people, they are rich, they know, and they are not just rich, they are rich, There is a lot of difference in this, so the people you see on social media, they more on looking, and these people are rich, even the descendants will be rich, who have not seen new money today, so the people who start earning new money on the internet, you will see that they have wings, so there is such a difference between show off and reality that a person spends more than his share, suppose there is 10 rupees and 8 rupees is being spent, there is 10 lakh rupees and a car of 8 lakhs is brought, so people can say show off here But if 10,000 rupees and 2 rupees are spent, then it is not show off, because they will earn 10,000 rupees and then earn 2,000 rupees, so the expense of 2 rupees is not an expense at all, so what I am saying may not be useful to you, but you will understand them, so if you do not have money today, so my first suggestion is you get a job, so we just talked about going to the dealer, in which your network will be made, you will see money and you will grow up, your skills will be enhanced, There is one more way to get a job, that there are many companies around you, there are builders who bring projects, they also offer jobs. So this is a little different segment but it is also attractive. Here commissions are very good. Like I told you that you get commissions up to 5% So these commissions are very good. Again you have to bring a client. But you always have to keep in mind that what am I going for? Am I going to earn money or learn? So here it is very important for you that who are you working under? So you will definitely get a senior. So if you think that this person can teach me, then take that job or don't take that job. Because learning is very important. So what will you learn here? You will learn one more thing. So as we talked here that you will learn inventory management, here you will learn lead generation That how to generate leads. Now this is not a common lead generation. Because you have to generate such leads that can spend a certain amount. 50 lakhs, 20 lakhs, 1 crore rupees can be spent for a shop, for an apartment, for a floor. So this lead generation of rich people, where will you get to learn? If you do a course, will you get to learn? No, you will not get to learn. Here you will understand what is called cold calling. Cold calling means people whom you don't know. You have to talk to them and convert them for sales. You won't get to learn this anywhere. Here you will get to learn. The salary that you are getting is the expense of your house and if any of your lead is converted and when there is a sale in front of you, you will understand that it is a very different level thing, but now I will tell you a reality. What is the reality? You will see such people who are working with dealers of 10,000, 20,000, 50,000. You will see such people who are working here. But can they all be rich? Not everyone can be successful in any field. There are many such people who play cricket very well. Does everyone go to the Indian cricket team? No I was listening to Virat Kohli's speech and he said that in the beginning he had no idea that he would ever play for an Indian cricket team Because he didn't have a vision. I am repeating Vision need. Those who are not successful, Vision is a very important factor in what can happen. What do you want to earn in life? What do you want in life? What do you want? Vision and vision is not like an apple of Newton that it will fall on your head or when you are involved in some field then you see that vision. Virat Kohli must have started playing cricket then someone must have told that there is something called Ranji and from Ranji people must have shown a vision that they can also go to Indian cricket team so vision will never come while sitting at home. So, for this vision, work is an important thing. What? Vision comes while working. Now, I will tell you a simple step. If you have no money, get a job man. And when you work, you will get a vision. So now climb the first ladder, you will see the way ahead of it. Okay, so I say this many times that one of my cousins was my grandfather, who left me very early. So when my grandfather started driving, he said that there was fog at that time, it was winter time, so he said that as far as you can see, you have to go there first. There is no need to go very fast because you will reach your destination. But sometimes there will be so much fog that you will not be able to see very far. Maybe you can only see a few feet away. So go a few feet, then you will see a little further. You have to move forward slowly, but don't do it that you drive very fast and the car gets stuck. You understand, he said a big thing according to his experience, maybe he didn't understand the real meaning in full detail, but I understood that we have to keep going, we have to go as far as the path is visible, so climb the first ladder, this is important, now let's talk about those people who have money, if you have money to invest Now you explained a concept that people who are in job, who are dealers, they only care about their brokerage They are interested in their commission. If today a person is convincing you to invest money here, invest money here, invest money here, then you have to ask yourself only one question. If I am investing here, will my money double in the next 5 years? And you have to ask the same question to them, if today you are telling me to buy this shop. Buy this floor. Or buy this plot. And you have money. You have money. Will it double if you invest today? You don't have to come just in talks, you need clarity, you need clarity. In the last 5 years, has the rate doubled here and if it did, then what factors caused it? What is the development here? Wherever you want to invest, there is a very clear formula. So here I will give a 3L concept There are three L's that you have to understand before investing in real estate. That is location. location. or location. Buy something expensive in good location, tomorrow again the same is expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same please keep these points in mind Buy something expensive in a good location and tomorrow again the same is probably expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same is expected So, location is the most important factor in Real Estate And then I told you that if there is money First of all, focus on the line. Because shops, flats and floors will be made. Who will make land? No one except God can make it. So land will not be made anymore. can't make more land, what is there is there, so today if the money is less, then add a little more, if it is less, then take a little small land, focus on the land, you will remember my words all your life and with this I think today I gave you a glimpse, I told you that you will not become rich with this video, but one thing is clear, the things I have told in this video and if you take action on them, then you will definitely become rich in life. Real estate is a vast topic, I really enjoy talking about it, I can talk about it for a whole day or a whole month, because I understood this thing very quickly in life that if you want to become a real millionaire, then it is necessary to invest in real estate. Maybe you can't do it immediately today, but add money and focus that I should definitely invest in real estate, there are many people who will tell you that do this better than this, do this better than this, do this better than this. Ask yourself the questions that I told you. Is it practical? Will you become rich from this? If you think yes, then you can comment yes. And you can share this video to spread the awareness. See, if you have less money today, you can invest it in SIP, Mutual Funds, Stocks, it's your choice. If you feel that you are getting a good real estate option, you are getting less than the intrinsic value, then invest. If you want to invest in the stock market today, you can open a Demat account for free. You will get the link in the description and comment box. And when the money is added, then focus on land, man. See you in the next video. Till that time, you can subscribe this channel, click on the notification bell, so that you don't miss the upcoming videos.

      "Now see, when we discussed that drastically real estate price doesn't go down, I was very clear with one thing and I want to give you the clarity of what I am clear in my mind.",
      "flats, apartments, villas, shops, we will talk about all this later.",
      "And if the demand increases, then the prices will also increase.",
      "How did your grandfather lose his property, sold it, lost the land, or made a mistake at that time by selling it and today its price is this much.",
      "There must be such things somewhere that the place where it was, today its price is this much, it used to be ours.",
      "So the top wealthy people of India, the top rich people, you will see one thing in common that they will have a lot of land, they will have a lot of land bank, they have a lot of land, and today you think how will we buy land, because it takes so much money, there are many such places in India, like if you talk about Mumbai or any big metropolitan city, buying land is a very big thing, because it has become so expensive.",
      "And in the coming time, whether the land increases or not, I am saying the first thing, whether it increases or not, because it takes time to multiply, but its price does not decrease.",
      "So although we talk a lot about the stock market, we talk about stocks, there are two types of assets, this is a real asset, that is a paper asset, both have their own value, both have their own advantages and disadvantages, now what is the advantage of stocks, that today you have bought 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 shares, which you cannot buy land from 50,000 in most places, but you have bought stocks of 50,000, if you ever want to sell it, then you can sell it in a day, money will come in your this thing is not possible so soon in land.",
      "Now, you might find this video lengthy but I will teach you what I have to teach you today because my point today is that I am giving you this in clarity by watching one video in a day, you will not become rich but you will become rich by taking action on the steps I will give in this video And if you are interested in real estate, then it is very important to listen to these things and sit in your mind So my prime focus is on land, I have told you the reason, population will increase, second thing is safe investment and depreciation is equal to zero, you will always see depreciation Although you will see that land is doubling every 6 years in good places, in some places you will say sir, what are you saying, I have seen it double in 2 years Yes, there is a time, but it is possible that the rate of land may not increase for 4-5 years, but it is possible that after 5-6 years, after 7 years, it will double and jump So these prices depend on many factors, so it is not like stock market, but it is different, but you need to understand this as well Now we were talking that there is no money, sir, you are saying there is no money and we are talking about land, okay, so now I will go step by step Today you do not have money, I told you one thing that your prime focus should be on land prime focus.",
      "Now most of the dealers will give you the first job, which I am telling you, that will be inventory management.",
      "Land means plots, what are the plots that are sold, what are the flats or floors that are sold Or if people want to give them on rent, then what are the floors and flats that can be found for rent, what are the shops, so this comes in the inventory, which is going to be sold, people want to sell and want to buy, so you will be taught inventory management, number one thing and for this inventory, you may be sent to the field that you go to the field and Bring the number of the builders.",
      "And he will mix the two and the brokerage will come.",
      "So this inventory management is the first thing you learn when you go inside a job.",
      "If you learn this, you will meet people who already have real estate, property, who want to sell it on rent So, number one, what will be the benefit of this?",
      "A person who wants to give his house on rent is rich.",
      "So sir, there is a saying in English that you are the average of five people you spend your time with.",
      "In the case of flats and floors, there is a commission of 2%.",
      "But when real estate deals are done, See, whatever we say today, Dealing in cash is illegal.",
      "So this is a little different segment but it is also attractive.",
      "So as we talked here that you will learn inventory management, here you will learn lead generation That how to generate leads.",
      "50 lakhs, 20 lakhs, 1 crore rupees can be spent for a shop, for an apartment, for a floor.",
      "The salary that you are getting is the expense of your house and if any of your lead is converted and when there is a sale in front of you, you will understand that it is a very different level thing, but now I will tell you a reality.",
      "You understand, he said a big thing according to his experience, maybe he didn't understand the real meaning in full detail, but I understood that we have to keep going, we have to go as far as the path is visible, so climb the first ladder, this is important, now let's talk about those people who have money, if you have money to invest Now you explained a concept that people who are in job, who are dealers, they only care about their brokerage They are interested in their commission.",
      "That is location.",
      "location.",
      "or location.",
      "Buy something expensive in good location, tomorrow again the same is expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same please keep these points in mind Buy something expensive in a good location and tomorrow again the same is probably expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same is expected So, location is the most important factor in Real Estate And then I told you that if there is money First of all, focus on the line.",
      "Because shops, flats and floors will be made."

And Anjali was laughing a lot. And your girl is gone as well. What went wrong today? You were going to\nreach before time today. Whose car did you bring now? You are looking like Pinky\nfrom Khirki Extension. What are you wearing? Look, bro. You can't reach anywhere if\nyou sail in two boats at the same time. Make a plan and see when you can\nquit your job. I sent you the assessment test\nby 1 Finance. For your financial planning.\nDid you fill that up? Mister. Have you surrendered in your life?\nWill you say something? Yes, bro. I am scared of making plans. Because God has cursed my destiny What's happening is that it is getting f**ked. Every day at all times for many years. Chauhan, I have become tired now. Bro, why are you taking\nso much pressure? We just have to devise a plan\nso that you can shift to Mumbai and aunt's treatment can also continue. We will do it, bro. Just take the test. It's a useful test.\nThat's why I am telling you. If it was a fake gimmick,\nwould I have asked you to do it? We will find out your financial\npersonality with its help. Which is very important\nfor the rest of the planning. Go and meet Pandit Ji once. The ending of the drama has been\nchanged for the first time in 25 years. And it happened when you became\nthe lead. He must have something in his mind. Huh? Just talk to him. He will empathise\nwith your situation. Don't worry. Neetu, can't I even express it\nif you aren't looking good? Tell me. -The problem doesn't lie\nwith my clothes. -Really? Your problem is that you want me\nto look just like them. Sophisticated and modern. Why? Can't I expect this? Then you should also look\nlike those boys. -I will then change.\n-How are these boys? I don't know. See for yourself. Do it in one shot. Come on. -Come on, guys. It's party time.\n-Friend. Keep it low, please. -We are talking.\n-Are you crazy or what? You came to the club to talk. -Let them talk. Continue talking.\n-Sorry. It won't happen again. -Continue talking.\n-Yes. -Silence, please.\n-Where are you going? Neetu. The car we came in tonight is the same car dad and brother\nwere supposed to return on that day. Where did you get that from? I bought it. Uncle sold it to Uncle Grover. I took it from him. For how much? -It doesn't matter.\n-Jimmy, how does it not matter? You didn't buy it for driving. Did you break the glass? It's just the trailer. -I will send you the video of the movie.\n-Jimmy. Look, you want to earn a lot of money\nand buy a house in DLF, Phase 1. You want to buy an SUV worth one crore. That's okay. But you will incur a lot of losses\nwhile trying to exact revenge. Jimmy, who do you want to exact\nrevenge on? Your uncle? It doesn't even matter to him\nwhat you are doing. He is too big. Neetu, it doesn't make a difference\nto me. What that broker did to my family and brother... These F**king wealthy people... Sorry! Wassup. -Guys.\n-Sorry. Cheers. Are you crazy? They are here to talk. -Don't spill it on them.\nThey have come to talk. -Hey. -Jimmy, look.\n-Oh no. He is more of a goon than a businessman. Your guy too is a goon. What is this? Friend, even I want to pop a bottle. But I don't know how to open it. -I will teach you. Yes.\n-Really? Shall I pop it from the back? The technology to pop it from\nthe back hasn't come to India yet. Hey, don't do that.\nAyaz, don't tease him. Come here. -Forget it.\n-Sit in the front. There will be a performance\nby Prashant today. Acting performance. And the lines are written by me. So, if you have memorised them, shall we begin, lead actor, Prashant? In the world, ha, ha, ha. The clients, ha, ha, ha. They are sometimes deceived. But the one who is deceived\nby the client... Sorry, sir. I can't do it. You can't do it? Why? You were going to play a big part at a huge event of a reputed\ntheatre company. Sorry. You are still going to play it.\nThis is nothing. It's just a couple of lines. Sir, looks like he didn't\nlike the script. He rejected it. Okay. That's okay. I will read them. In the world, the clients... In the world, the clients\nare sometimes deceived. Sir, this is copied. The following lines\nare absolutely original. In the world, the clients\nare sometimes deceived. But the one who is deceived\nby the client... But the salesman who is deceived\nby the client is called a F**king moron. He is called a big F**king moron.\nHe is F**king called Prashant Narula. Now, do you want to add anything\nabout yesterday's F**k up? Sir, as I said earlier, -I made a mistake and I am sorry\nfor that. -Sir. Sir, there is a body in your cabin. Sir, there is a dead body. Body? Sir, there is a dead body. Come. What shall we do? You had to check if he is breathing. He is still breathing. He is not dead. -So, wake him up.\n-Hey, wake up. Hey, wake up. Brother. Hey. Get up. Give me water. Who are you? Water. Are you water? Are you F**king stupid? I am asking for water. Give me water. F**ker, increase the AC temperature.\nIt's too F**king cold. It's my joining in the office today. I didn't have a place to rest. I have a meeting with Shushur. Rajkumar Mehta. Do you know each other? No. I am Shushur. Your boss. You are fired. F**k. So, are all the children sharing\ntheir dreams with someone every day? -Yes, sir.\n-Good. Who are doing it? Only some of you are doing it? Why aren't the rest doing it? Sir, I told my dad that I would grow up to become\nthe captain of the India Cricket Team. But dad scolded me. -What did your dad say?\n-Dad told me that millions of people try for it and only one becomes a captain among them. The rest of them starve to death. Okay. Has everyone watched Harry Porter here? -Yes, sir.\n-You have watched it, right? You must have seen dementors in that. -Yes, sir.\n-The dementor. -Yes, sir.\n-What do they do? -Sir, they used to eat away the soul.\n-Correct. They used to eat away the soul. What do you mean by that? Your happiness, your hopes, all your good memories,\nthey used to eat away everything. And what was the defensive spell called? -The Patronus Charm.\n-The Patronus Charm. -Expecto Patronum.\n-Very good. Do you know that there are dementors roaming around us? They are called dream dementors. No. I am not joking. These dream dementors make you dreamless. How do they make you dreamless? They eat away all your excitement. They eat away your optimism. They eat away your courage. What is left if all these things\nare gone? You become frightened, dull and scared. You become dreamless. You become just a mere follower. Has anyone seen these dream dementors? -No, sir.\n-No, sir. Has anyone seen these dream dementors? -No, sir.\n-You have. But you couldn't recognise them. Because they don't come forward. They get inside your dad's mind. Sometimes, they get into your mom\nor friends. They get into your relatives at times. And sometimes, they even attack\nyour own mind. But there is nothing to worry about.\nWe still have hope no matter what. Just like Patronus Charm, even I have the charm to drive these\ndementors away. This charm was attained by a sage\nfrom God who meditated for 150 years\nunder a Peepal tree on Mount Kilimanjaro. And I learned it from him. And I am going to tell all of you\nthat charm now. So, whenever these dream dementors get inside your dad, friend or your own mind and start attacking and you start doubting your dream, make an image of this dream in your mind\nto start with and then loudly say this\nto the dream dementor.

What did I say? Actually, I had my earphones plugged in. -How many times should I hit you?\n-What? You didn't hear me. How many times should I hit you\nwith my shoe? You can hit me twice. Well, you can hit me four times\non the safer side. Call Grover and tell him that\nI called him to the office. -Okay?\n-Yes. Should I call him?\nOr do you want to hit me first? Look, you motherF**ker. You love plugging things inside, right? Then plug it in one of the holes. Leave the other one open. To listen to people. Okay? Call Grover and ask him\nto come to the office. Sir, he was just too much.\nHow did you even hire him? He was Prashant's replacement. -Don't tell anyone in the office yet.\n-Sure. I have to find someone else. So, does that mean you are going\nto fire Prashant? What that motherF**ker is doing... That's my perception. He doesn't finalise the\nhigh-commissioned deals deliberately. Why wouldn't he sell it deliberately? Because some people\nare fixated on ethics. There are legal issues in the properties\nin high-commissioned deals. So, he doesn't sell them. I am incurring a loss in my commission\nbecause of him. And then he F**king talks big. Sir, I am the lead actor in my play.\nPlease let me leave sooner. I am an ordinary person.\nBut I fly so high in the sky. Shishir brother. Lighter milega? Choti Gold. Real Saelu ki nishani. Brother, Malayalam is one\nof my favourite languages. Mujhe Malayalam ke sath sath\naur bhi 11 languages aati hai. Aur aapki company ko\nbohot fayda ho sakta hai isse. I told you in English upstairs. Now, I will say it in Malayalam. You are fired. All the small salesmen indeed\nsmoke small Gold. But not everyone who smokes a small Gold\nis a salesman. Lighter, please. I am holding onto the lighter so that\nyou don't leave without hearing me out. You judged me right.\nI am not a salesman. But I would grow up to become one. My family, relatives, other students in my school\nand teachers knew that. The other kids used to fly kites\nin the childhood. There was a child who used to sell\nthe kite to the one who owned it. And that child was me. There was an option to pursue a BBA\nor MBA after school. But they say that selling and F**king can only be\nlearnt by practising them. So, to hell with studies. I joined a telemarketing company. Hello, am I speaking to Shishir? The line is disconnected. Brother, the most difficult\nand humiliating selling. Sometimes, three to four rejections\nin a minute but I did it. Why? Because I knew that without meeting someone in person and without their interest... Forget\nabout interest. That which is the most irritating for the telemarketer,\ndespite that, if I can prevent him\nfrom disconnecting the call and he listens to me. And with time, he starts showing\ninterest in what I am saying. And finally, he buys what I am trying\nto sell, brother, then I won't be a salesman. I will be the God of salesmen. And now, I am the sales God. Hey, hero. Even if you talk romantically\nlike Shah Rukh Khan, children can't be conceived with that. You still need to know how to F**k. Come on. Let's test the God of sales. I realised it at night\nwhile I was lying down. That 455, Sector 7, is Mr. Kukreja's construction site. I called the auditor\nin the middle of the night. He started trembling as soon\nas he heard the name. Then he came and paid 10,000 rupees\nat midnight with regards. What's the furniture\nused by ladies called? Yes. The dressing table. I got it picked up. I got it loaded in the tempo.\nAnd now, it's placed in your lobby. Actually, he paid 8,000. He drank alcohol worth 2,000. The alcoholic men don't know\nhow to maintain relationships. I added 2,000 from my pocket. Then take it back. What? Take it back. Well, Mr. Kukreja is great. Prem, Ramesh, the sweeper,\nwho cleans the place. What's his salary for a month? -2,000 rupees.\n-2,000. Ask him not to come from tomorrow. The one who took my money, send him here. Tell him that Kukreja sent Ramesh\non leave. Ask him to clean the place for a month. Okay? As you say, Mr. Kukreja. Why should I keep your 2,000 rupees? Here it is, sir. With regards. It belongs to you. Ratan Dealer. At your service. Okay then, sir. This is also fine. Okay then. -Grover.\n-Yes. Who is the boy who took 5 lacs\nfrom my client? Kukreja, Balwant from the party. He said that the house was sold. We ordered the furniture from Bantu. For the house. So, Bantu has taken my 5 lac rupees? -Do this.\n-Yes. Call Bantu. I don't know him personally.\nI took help from someone. Who? Jimmy. Why the F**k isn't my lighter working? Quick! Nikhil. Give him the background of the deal. Mr. Harshmeet. A premium prospect. He has selected a property\nin Royal Palms, Gurgaon. Worth a whopping 25 cr. We have been conversing with him\nfor two months now. But he hasn't sealed the deal yet. And he isn't telling us\nwhat the problem is. I told sir about it. Do you remember it? That uncle is just checking out\nthe properties. He doesn't have the budget. But upon sir's request, we have one final call with him\nthis afternoon at 11. Do you have a recording\nof the last call? We are a transparent company. We have recordings of all the calls. Okay. Well, then play it for me once. Hello, Harshmeet sir, how are you? Hello. Everything is fine, son.\nHow are you? I am good too, sir. I called to ask that you liked the flat in\nRoyal Chambers, right? Yes, son. I liked it. I told you that earlier as well.\nThe kids also liked it. Sir, since you and your family\nliked it and it's in the budget, there is nothing else to wait\nfor to close the deal. Well, I am sure that... -It's not over yet.\n-But I can't listen to it anymore. I am breathing in, in the same room\nyou are breathing out. Thinking about that is making me feel\nthat my sales skills are becoming weak. Hey. Don't F**king waste my time. -Get to the point.\n-Sure, brother. Take notes. My brother, Maninder,\nused to say something. He used to say that one shouldn't deal in business with the one\nhe doesn't like. One should have business dealings\nwith the one you like. Why were you talking to uncle\nin English? Because, brother, we are a premium real estate company. And we sell premium properties\nto premium clients. Who expect to talk to well-spoken,\nwell-groomed individuals. Did Uncle Harshmeet tell you this? He wouldn't have said so. Brother, you should keep the smoke\nof a cigarette inside. And nonsensical talk outside. Both can cause throat cancer.\nThey should be kept in check. Uncle is talking to you in Punjabi. If you spoke to uncle in Punjabi even if it isn't that fluent,\ndo you know how good he would have felt? And then you would have left\na nice impression. Then uncle would have told you\nfrankly what he has been thinking. F**king hell. The slogan\nwas used a hundred years ago but Simon still hasn't gone back yet. Your next basic mistake. -I hope everyone is taking notes.\n-Sir, it's 11 am. It's time for the call.\nCan we please get on with it? No one has time for baseless sales hacks\nby Satinder. -It's Maninder.\n-Yes. Whatever it is. Yeah. Let's do the call. Nikhil, do this. Let him pretend to be your boss. Show us the practical. His next basic mistake. He was selling. Don't try to sell. Let him buy it. Someone is buying a home for 25 crores. He should feel that he is buying it\nout of his own will. Not a 25-year-old boy whose\nsalary for 25 years can't even amount to 25 crores should decide\nfor him. Hello? Hello, Mr. Harshmeet, how are you\nholding up? I mean, sir, how are you? I am fine, son.\nI was doing the paperwork. Actually, I finalised the house. Okay. Sir, can I ask why we didn't go with\nthe Royal Chambers flat? Was it because it was too expensive? No, son. Actually, this one is more expensive. Hello, greetings to you, Harshmeet. This is Nikhil's senior speaking. Sir, I heard that you have finalised\nyour home. Hearty congratulations to you.\nMay God bless your home. Thank you so much. Harshmeet, I wanted\nto ask you something. Sir, what can we do in the future\nso that you would have a deal with us when it comes to buying a house?\nI am just asking for your feedback. Son, is the call on speaker? Speaker? Not at all.\nThe call is not on speaker. Please tell me. -Should I tell you about it?\n-Yes. He wasn't making me feel\nthat I had an option. Really? -I am the one investing 30 crores.\n-That's right. -By the way, shall I give you\nsome advice? -Yes, sure. I have a friend named Maninder Chawla.\nHe always says this. One should have business dealings\nwith the one you like. One shouldn't deal in business\nwith the one he doesn't like. -That's right. You too.\n-Take care. Show it to me. Take the photographs, brothers. You are skilled. But I would try you for a month first. Because your actions and your gangster tattoos, I have doubts whether you will be able to work in a corporate setup. -Sir, did you call for me?\n-Yes, come in. Rajkumar, he is Prashant. One of our most committed salesman. You will shadow him for some time. My younger brother's name\nwas also Prashant. What do you mean by was?\nDid he change it now? No, brother. He has the same name.\nBut he isn't my brother anymore. Sorry for your loss. Prashant, take Rajkumar\nto all of your meetings. Take him to the Arihant Society\nmeeting today. -He will understand the company's\nprocesses. -Okay, sir. And lead actor, Prashant, today's deal is super important. The client has the money\nas well as the intent. So, go and get him. Yeah? And then we will meet in the evening\nin the office. At 7 O'clock. Lead actor Prashant. What is this F**king nonsense? It's not F**king nonsense. I am an actor. It's Shishir's habit to turn\nit into F**king nonsense. You mean a serious actor? Like Ayushmann Khurrana and\nKartik Aaryan? -Like them?\n-I am as serious as them. It's just that I am not that big yet. So, do you have a plan to become that big? Not that big. Bigger than that. The best actor of all time. It's amazing, friend. Then both of us have a similarity. What? That whatever we want,\nwe just don't want it for the sake of it but we want to make the most of it. And you also say it with pride like me. What do you want? Money. But I want insane amounts of money. Unlimited, countless and immeasurable money. Do you have a plan? I have a master plan. You should never make fun\nof someone's helplessness. You get cursed. Those who are already\ncursed dont get cursed again. I have something to attend to. It will\ntake 10 minutes and then we will go. As you wish, my friend. You left the theatre two days before the\nshow and went to Mumbai to do the film. I was then asked to not allow you in Satyanweshi again. But I took you back. I even gave you a lead role. Because I remember the Prashant\nfrom two years ago whose dream was to become\nthe best actor in the world. And when I see you today,\nthings are different. The priority of today's Prashant\nis his mother. That's why his priority is his job. Which is justified. But, Prashant, your old dream. The dream of becoming\nthe greatest actor, you have to let go of it. -How is uncle doing?\n-Jimmy, it's a mess. Your uncle found out that you\nwere a part of yesterday's deal. He is now saying that we placed\nthe furniture in his place and sold them to his client.\nSo, the money belongs to him. We have to return it to him. What money, uncle? I gave you the money. Jimmy, give me the car back. I will sell the car and return\nthe money to your uncle. Jimmy, or you can arrange 5 lacs and give it to your uncle. Hello? Tell me what to do, Jimmy. What can be done? Uncle, let's do it. I will send you a message. Make my uncle read it. I shall leave now. When I go to sleep at night, I don't get sleep many times. Whatever happened during the day\nkeeps running on my mind. Who abused me in different ways at office today? And what will they humiliate me\nfor tomorrow? Mom's health doesn't seem fine today. Shall I consult another doctor? I couldn't talk to mom due to work\npressure today. Shall I talk to her now? She must be asleep now. I will talk to her in the morning.\nBut what if... It's mental torture, Pandit Ji. I think about just one thing\nand then fall asleep. This play. This is the only time of the day, when I think about it, I feel that there is still hope. And if I stay with that, I will reach where my dream is. Just one last chance, Pandit Ji. Please. I have asked three people to prepare a monologue. Prashant, you will see that Samarth will do\nvery well. That's what I feel.\nMaybe he will be better than you. And if someone is more talented\nthan you, then they too should get a chance. Right? It's fair. Okay then. You should perform with them as well. Then we will see. The one who performs the best, the one to do the lead role will be decided then. -Thank you, Pandit Ji.\n-No. That's okay. Bro, tell me something. Your boss sells apartments\nworth 20 crores or more. This apartment is worth only 3 crores. Then why is he so worried\nabout selling this one? The value of the property\nis not the only factor. The commission must be more then. It must be around 4-5%\nas it's a low-selling society. How much does it amount to anyway? Does it look like a low-selling\nproperty to you? And the commission is 2% on papers. Great. More commission\non high-selling properties then. That means something is wrong\nwith the property. On paper, the commission of 2%\nwill go to Shishir and you. I haven't earned even a single penny by lying in the 14 months\nthat I have been working. Nor would I do that. If you know the truth and you still\ndon't reveal it is the same as lying. Do you think he'd tell him that there\nis something wrong with the property? -Hi. How are you?\n-Hello. -Shall we go and see the apartment?\n-One minute, Prashant. We can have a look at the flat anytime. I wanted to ask you something\nbefore this. Is this property legally okay? Legally okay as in? Look, I have been looking for a flat\nfor the past couple of months. So, my number is available\non the property dealer network. I got a call from a dealer randomly. I asked him for options. He showed me many options\nbut they were outside my budget. After that, he told me about a property. Which was within my property. But he clearly told me that there are a few issues\nin the property papers. Which he will try and legally sort out. I hope you understand\nwhere this conversation is going. The flat we have come to see. Absolutely. This flat. But anyway, if your company\ncan certify it for me that this flat is legit for sale, then we can go and take a look\nright now. I have no problem. Please give me a little time. I will find out and let you know\nif there is such an issue. -Let's go and check out more flats\ntill then. -No, friend. I will wait for your revert\nfor this particular flat. I hope you understand my position. I completely understand, sir. -I will see you later. Thanks.\n-Thank you. You are saying that you didn't\nlie to a client in 14 months that you have been working. You could have had to lie today. But a random dealer called\nthe client today. Yes, bro. It happens sometimes. The client doesn't like\nthe property sometimes and then there are\nother reasons like today. God helped me. That's it. God helped you. And God helps those who help themselves. Therefore, Prashant helped himself. Therefore, the random call to the client\nwasn't random. You got the call made to him. And the question is, why did you get\nthe call made? One and a half years back, my mom was diagnosed with cancer. The doctor said that an immediate\noperation is necessary. But I was in Mumbai then. My costume trials were going on. Of the first film of my life. And the main hero was me. Just like Kartik Aaryan and Ayushmann Khurrana. The expense of the operation\nwas 10 to 12 lacs. But that was fine. As mom had medical insurance. That's what dad thought. Because when we called\nthe insurance company, they said that it's normal\nmedical insurance, not for critical illnesses. The agent said so and sold it to my dad. What do I say about what happened later? I came back. I had to come. I couldn't do the movie. Now, I have a job. So that the expense of mom's treatment\nfor every month can be met. Do you know how much the agent\nearned out of it? 15,000 rupees. 15,000 rupees. We don't think about how small unfair dealings can ruin someone else's life. No one does. Look, I don't know where the client got the call from. But the chance of someone's life getting spoiled\nbecause of this deal is zero. My dad is just like you. Hopeful and honest. And that's why he is destroyed. Brother, a man went to the jungle. He didn't have a gun or any preparation. The bear devoured him. Bro, is the bear evil?\nOr is the man a F**king moron? Bro, there is a difference between\nsociety and a jungle. The animals are intellectually\nhelpless in the jungle. -Really?\n-We aren't helpless. We always have a choice\nof not doing the wrong thing. No, we don't, bro. The only choice is that you can either become\na bear and attack someone or become a rabbit and be pounced upon. That's it. The bear ate the rabbit there. And the scoundrels are devouring\nthe good men here. Bro, these buildings, malls, good roads, courts, police stations, civilised clothes, English-speaking... English-speaking people, don't be fooled by looking at all this. This is still a jungle. There was an honest man here. A good man. He still had a little bit\nof decency left. He was then suppressed\nand forced to be frightened by the F**king world. Get it, Prince? Who is Prince? Did I say Prince? But, Major sir, where\ndid this fear come from? Hey, I am also rehearsing. And it got instilled within\nas if settling in a home. Why should I seek a button\nto turn it on and off? Tell me something. How is it decided whose audition\nis the best? My Guruji will decide that. Then seek your Guruji's blessing\nbefore the audition today. Would that make my performance better? No. But if Guruji gives you his blessing, then his ego will get involved in this. If he blesses you and you still don't win, who will be insulted? You? Guruji's blessing. Try that today. Hello? Hey, what is this message? 10 wads of currency of 500 worth 5 lacs. Uncle, would you take it up\nyour mouth or hand? Or should I shove it up? -Sorry.\n-Did you make my uncle read it? -Where are you? -I am going\nto the club in sector 4. Come there. I am coming. You are a vigilant turtle\nas per the assessment. Well, okay. Is it good or bad? Someone is an introvert\nand the other is an extrovert. Is that good or bad? Someone likes numbers more\nand the other likes poems and paintings. Is it good or bad? It's neither. It's just his personality. Just like this is your personality. Your personality regarding money. Without labelling your personality, working according to it\nis called being sensible. Look, an introvert is happy to work in an environment where he has to interact\nwith minimal people. Similarly, a vigilant turtle would feel happier\nin such a financial plan which would be in accordance\nwith his money personality. Do you understand? So, my financial plan will be made\naccording to my financial personality? Exactly. But you first need to know what you\nwant in your life financially. Like you want to quit your job\nand shift to Mumbai. And your responsibilities\ndon't suffer as well. Having desires is easy. But you also have to understand what your current situation is. And for that, we will book a call on the 1 Finance app\nwith their financial advisor. For you. He would get to understand everything\nfrom you. Bro, even you work at 1 Finance. Please do it for me.\nGod knows who I will get once I book it. I don't know if I can trust him or not. I trust you, bro. Bro, why do you worry so much? There is no greed for commission here\nlike your company. Because there is no commission\nin our company. All the advisors are qualified\nfinancial advisors here. What's happening? -We are preparing.\n-We are rehearsing. Bro, I will make you understand\nin detail. Go and rock the audition now. -Go for it.\n-Is everyone ready? -Shall we start?\n-Samarth. -Would you start? Come on then.\n-Yes. Come, bro. -Come upstairs, uncle.\n-I am coming. I am behind you. But, Major sir, where did this fear come from? And it got instilled within\nas if settling in a home. Why should I seek a button\nto turn it on and off? Why don't we get rid of the fear\naltogether? Soldier, fear isn't completely useless. Prashant. Are you ready? Come on then. Seek your Guruji's blessing\nbefore the audition today. Would that make my performance better? No. But if Guruji gives you his blessing, then his ego will get involved in this. Bro, you didn't return the money. Your uncle got me trembling. Please talk to him once. -Come on.\n-Hey, you. Why are you creating a mess? Please come. Dagar. Get him here with love. Well, finish this peg and come. Okay? Dagar, he is coming.\nHis peg is almost over. He is coming. Dagar, wait. Come with me willingly\nor I will have to drag you. Uncle, give me a cigarette at least. But, Major sir, where did this fear come from? And it got instilled within\nas if settling in a home. Why should I seek a button\nto turn it on and off? Why don't we get rid of the fear\naltogether? Soldier, fear isn't completely useless. If it was so, a man wouldn't\nrun after seeing a lion. He would have stood still. And then the lion would have\ndevoured him. But fear saves him by indicating him\nto escape. You don't get scared, do you? He is just your uncle. No matter whatever mess you create, what will he do? He won't obviously kill you. He has killed one already. Uncle. It's not burning anymore. Move it. Give me my 5 lacs back. Otherwise, I would go to your dad to get it back. And along with 5 lacs, I would take a little bit\nof his honour as well. Whatever is left of it anyway. A big dealer in Gurgaon came along with his bouncers just for 5 lacs. Listen up, you rodent. Whether it's 5 lacs, 5 crores or 5 rupees, whoever takes my share of the money, I have screwed them so bad that they can't have children now. You have tried to mess with me\na couple of times before as well. And I had mercy on you and spared you. But the next time, two boys will come on a motorcycle and split your head in two. Come, Dagar. Come on. Have a good party. -Why are all of you so quiet?\n-Uncle. I wanted to show you something\nnow that you are here. But, Major sir, when people\nused to stay in the jungle, getting scared of the lion\nwas justified. But why does the same fear\nscare me in my home in the city? Dad was scared that boss might take away the job. Mom was scared that her son's wife might take away her son from her. I killed my passion for playing hockey and joined the army. I was scared for my self-respect that the neighbours might think\nthat I am worthless. No one was scared for their lives\nin all of this. And today, while sitting on the border, when my life is in danger, I can understand how worthless\nthe fear was. And maybe people realise this\nonce more in life. When he is lying on his bed in old age and watch his entire life flash by\nright in front of his eyes. And then he tells himself. If I wasn't afraid of imaginary ghosts all my life, God, I would have lived a life full of fulfillment! God, I would have died a peaceful life! 'If I wasn't afraid of imaginary ghosts\nall my life,' God, I would have lived a life full of fulfillment! God, I would have died a peaceful life!",

      "string": "Good morning. Ma'am, did you call me? Come in. Mr. Sumit, I have received complaints\nfrom a few parents. Their children have been behaving\nweirdly for the past couple of weeks. The children are saying\nthat it is their homework from the music class. Ma'am, what do you mean by they are\nbehaving weirdly? What are they doing? They are talking to themselves\nby looking in the mirror. They are talking to non-living things. When someone scolds them or tries\nto make them understand, they start chanting a mantra which says\nsomething like jhugli jhugli. By the way, I have heard something\nsimilar coming from your class as well. No, ma'am. It's just a simple\npsychological trick to reduce fear in them, ma'am. I have made them believe that\nsaying the charm will make the ones lose their power who are trying to scare or demotivate\nthem. It's the placebo effect, ma'am. In short, I am just supporting\nour school's motto, ma'am. Be brave. -So... -Mr. Sumit, did you learn\nthis psychology from someone? Do you know of any schools\nthat practising this? No, ma'am. It's my personal invention. From what I have learnt personally,\nyou know. Mr. Sumit, my kids are not guinea pigs whom you are using for experimenting\nwith your psychological inventions. I think we hired you to teach music. So, I request you to just stick to that. Ma'am, I am sorry but dead people\ncan't create music. In fact, anything good for that matter. But if we teach a child\nhow to listen to their dreams and how to take care of them\nand how to fight for them, ma'am, whatever that child does\nafter that, it would be just pure and divine. Whether it's music or Maths. Sorry, ma'am, I am just being honest.\nI am really impressed with this thought. Mr. Sumit, the problem these days is that the teachers are very much\ninfluenced by the movies. They think of themselves\nas Aamir Khan of Taare Zameen Par. -Hey.\n-Hence, all this romanticized talk. So, can I please request you to stop trying to be a hero and just be\na good music teacher instead? Take this as a first and last warning. Ma'am, you are right.\nI sometimes try to be a hero but we all have got it wrong when we think\nabout what being a hero means. That will be all for now. Sir, may I come in? Sir, shall we start the activity\nof saying our dream out loud? Principal ma'am scolded me today as I am not teaching the students music. So, let's learn a poem today. The name of the poem is, Who Is A Hero? Uncle, maybe you don't even remember.\nThis is the same car in which my dad and brother were going to return from your elder\nson's wedding. But you had a problem that my dad might puke on the exquisite seats of your\nprecious car because he was drunk. You sent them home in a scooty. My brother won't ever return. Uncle, everything that humiliate my family and me, I will burn them. Uncle, I will burn you someday as well. Hey. I will buy you two beers.\nMake a nice video. If I wasn't afraid of imaginary ghosts\nall my life, God, would I have lived\na life of fulfilment? God, would I have died in peace? -You were too good.\n-Thank you. Prashant. It was beautiful. Thank you. Manan, are you leaving? Her eyes suggest that she won't mind if you\nmake her wear the nuptial chain. So, I have seen the performances\nof four of you. Before the rehearsals tomorrow, I will announce my decision\nof who will play the main role. -Guys, he did a great job.\n-Yes, it was beautiful. -Too much. Bye.\n-Okay. Bye. Anjali. Hi. How did you like the performance? I told you. It was amazing. No one was even\nclose to your performance. You were perfect. Okay. -Are you dating someone now?\n-Huh? No. It's nothing. Please let me know if you have\nany other feedback. Okay. By the way, I am not dating anyone now. Okay. Yeah. We... Okay. By the way, we can meet. Before or after the rehearsals. I am in. Yes. Sure. Cool. -Okay.\n-Okay then. -Bye.\n-Bye. Hey, bro. How did it go? -Shall we?\n-Let's go. I will tell you. Did you speak to her? I didn't give you the bottle\njust to hold it. Keep sipping a little water. You too should return early\nfrom the office today. Someone should be at home\nif there is an emergency. -Okay.\n-What is okay? Don't you have rehearsals today? You should attend your rehearsal and\nthen return. There is no emergency. -I am not going to have chemotherapy for\nthe first time. -Please have water. You too should do what you feel like. God knows what kind of rehearsal\nthey have which can't be avoided even for a day.\nEven if someone dies. The rehearsal can be avoided for a day. I have let go of many other things\nas well. I am not making you count them. I am saying it so that you don't\nsay it again. What did I say?\nDid I say something to him? Do you see how he is talking to me? Your job should be your priority\nright now. Your mom's treatment is dependent\non your salary. You are telling your boss that\nyou can't spare time for your work and you are telling me\nthat you won't spend time at home. To hell with such rehearsal. Is this acting sensibly? -Keep drinking a little water.\n-If you shout one more time, then I would get out of the car\nand come to the hospital in an auto. Then you can keep drinking\na little bit of water. Listen. Finish your rehearsal and then return. I will come to see your play this time. Your friends keep calling you an actor but you never showed us\nyour performance. Just take care of your health.\nI will call you. You won't call me. I will surely come\nthis time. You always used to say\nthat you would call me when you play the lead role in the play. That you will call me\nwhen the film releases. You are playing the lead\nrole in the play now, right? I will come this time. It will happen in three weeks. If you take care of your health\nproperly, -then I will take you.\n-Perfect. You know, I have decided that I will\nwear a T-shirt in which it will written in bold, Hero's Mother. Tell me something. There must be\na heroine if you are playing the hero. -No.\n-There is no heroine. What kind of story is this? Mom, there are girls.\nThere is no heroine. And there are stories with a heroine\nbut no hero. Really? I thought you probably didn't\ncall me because you must be shy\nto perform a romantic scene with a girl in front of your mom. 'What are you doing?' Prince, my boy. Your laces are open. And what did you Guruji say yesterday? -He will tell us today.\n-Okay. And you called me Prince again. Did I say Prince? -Did you try the trick of touching\nthe feet? -It wasn't necessary. It wasn't necessary. But you said that\nGuruji will announce the result today. But, bro, the actor gets\nto know about it. He would surely select me. -What is she saying?\n-Who is saying what? Bro, my younger brother, Prashant, his pet name was Prince. He was passionate about acting like you. He too was naive like you. He too used to cross his legs while\ntalking to a girl. Just like you. -Nikhil.\n-Yes, sir. Call Prashant. -Actually, call everyone.\n-Okay, sir. Prashant, Shishir sir is calling\nfor you. And he has asked everyone to be there. So, that means you too. Come here. Sit. Sit. I was asking Mrs. Kavita that one of my employees is a lead actor in a reputed theatre,\nthen how come I got to know it so late? -How was the practice yesterday?\n-I didn't go, sir. I texted you. I was coming to the office\nand my car broke down. But actually, I want\nyou to go regularly. That you don't miss\na single day's practice. But to decide if you actually have\nthe talent or not so that we can allow you\nto go for your practice, we have to see your performance. Listen up, everyone.\nPrashant is going to perform something. There will be a voting in the end.\nSo, watch carefully. -Sir.\n-Whenever you are ready. Now? Why? You are a big hero from a big theatre. And the hero should always\nbe ready whenever someone asks. To act, right? Come on. Do it. Everyone is waiting. So, I would like to perform a poem. The name of which is, Who Is A Hero? It was long ago in time. But I still remember it. I had a teacher. He was silent in the class. Then he lifted his head. And asked everyone. Kids, -tell me.\n-Who is a hero? The kids replied, those with silky hair. And whose chest shines through\nthe open buttons. He walks in style.\nEvery girl looks at him in awe. Their movies are released\nin the theatres. DDLJ, Gadar, Sholay and Don. Sir heard that and laughed. He said, no. Think more. Tell me, who is a hero? The kids got confused. That's how heroes are. Amitabh Bachchan.\nShah Rukh Khan. Salman Khan. Then a child said in the end\nwith full confidence. Sir. I will say it. Sir, someone who wins the game\nno matter which game he plays. No one can defeat him. Someone with a biceps of 20 inches. And the chest of 56 inches. No alcohol can make them drunk. He is so powerful and masculine\nthat even a don is scared of him. Sir heard that and laughed even\nmore loudly. Then he said, no. Think more and tell me. Who is... -A hero?\n-Who is a hero? The kids got confused now. They used the definition already. But they can't figure out who a hero is. Sir, please tell us.\nWe have a headache now. Sir laughed a little. And said, I know a few heroes. Who never won. Forget about the movie theatres, they were not even recognised\nin their neighbourhood. How would they have silky hair? They don't even fond of combs. And their walk? Their walk is so frail that they might fall with the next step. They never got respect from society. They didn't even get a house, friend or love from a girl. I know a few heroes. Who were destined to lose\neven before they could fight. The kids replied, sir, how can this\nbe a hero? Sir asked, how can this be a hero? He is a hero because... -Why do we need a vote after this?\n-Too good, sir. Congratulations. You can go to your practice every day. -Thank you, sir.\n-Kavita, put it in the mail officially. Everyone else should go to the field. -I got goosebumps.\n-It was just amazing. It was a great performance. I loved it. -Narrate the whole story later.\nIt was left midway. -Sure. It was truly amazing, bro. -Prashant, I have sent you the mail.\nMeet me once you go through it. -Sure. -Good day, bro.\n-That was just too good. I loved it. It was splendid. Truly amazing, bro. Your job should be your priority\nright now. Your mom's treatment is dependent\non your salary. -I will let you know after the search.\n-Sir. Let me get back and make a call. Okay? Sir, can we talk for two minutes? Prashant, actually, I had to talk to\nyou as well. So, the thing is that your replacement\nis Rajkumar. You have 15 days for the complete\nhandover. And month end will be your last\nworking day in office. Sir. Sir, I wanted to talk about termination. Sir, I never got a warning to date. Sir, I thought that everything\ngot settled about -whatever happened at\nthe society the other day. -Prashant. You are thinking that\nI fired you because of the fuck up at the society? Or because you went to\nyour rehearsal yesterday? Yes. That's the official reason\nI told HR about. But in reality, why did I fire you? You should think about that. And if you\ncan't figure it out till the last day, then I would tell you. But the meeting for that will\ntake place at 7 in the evening. -Sir, but...\n-Don't forget the handover to Rajkumar. Do you have two minutes? Tell me, bro. What the fuck is this? Brother, relax. It's a lighter. Maybe. Do you know what the problem is? I have a real gun exactly like this one. It has the same design.\nIt weighs the same. It is usually kept in the same place. I have to check whether it's a gun\nor a lighter every time I have to light a cigarette.\nBy taking out the magazine. I sometimes don't do it. When my mood is bad, I leave everything to chance. It's fine if it's a lighter. -It's also fine if it's a bullet.\n-Hey. Do you want to make\ntwo crores in two days? Is your mood fine today? Did you check if it's a lighter\nor a gun? Let's try and find out. Hey, don't! It's a lighter. Brother, so, the scheme is that a high-rise is being built\nat Golf Course Extension in Gurgaon. Two towers. 20 floors. 4 flats per floor. But the permission was only\nfor 10 floors. The builder paid the money in advance\nand took the approval. As soon as the new officer came,\nhe stopped the construction. He asked them to pay a proper penalty. And if they don't pay the penalty in the next month,\nthe construction will be stopped. What does the builder say? If they pay such a huge penalty, there won't be any profits. Hey, come to the point.\nWhere would two crores come from? The builder is looking for a big firm. Who could sell as many remaining\nunits as possible. Before the news comes out\nabout the construction being stopped. Brother. 110 units are still pending\nout of 160 units. Even if we sell 20 of them, you will get 10% of the selling price. And 10% of one unit worth one crore\nis 10 lacs. And even if we sell 20 units, brother, you will get two crores. And what percentage will you get? Only 5%. Where were you for so many years? I will tell you\nin your favourite language. If you ever bring this f**king lighter in the office, I will fire you on the spot. And there will be a police case as well. Brother, I am talking about 15%. Get the fuck out of my office! I will introduce you to a couple\nof people after your rehearsal. The salary could be a little less\nbut they would find you a job. You can take a break if you are not\nin the mood today, bro. I have a meeting. I will attend that. You told Shishir, didn't you? About what we spoke about yesterday. About how the client got a call? Shall I tell you the truth? Bro, I would have told him\nif it benefited me. But it wasn't going to benefit me. Benefit? That scoundrel, Shishir\nis not benefiting from me. As I am not lying to people and selling them houses. That's why. Now, you have replaced me. To benefit him. The one who sold the wrong insurance to mom was also concerned\nabout his benefit. And his boss. My benefit. My commission. My money. My everything. What about the other? No matter if the other person's\nlife is ruined and even if he dies, they should just continue benefiting\nfrom it. Prince. This is life, bro. Everyone will look out\nfor their benefit. Bro, the lion will eat according\nto his appetite in the jungle. He doesn't fucking care about how\nmiserable the mother of the deer felt. Humans left the jungle and came out\nof it a long time ago. Here. Because something different\nis here. In the villages and cities. There is a certain way to achieve\nanything here. Which is different from the jungle. If it was a jungle, people would have\ngotten things by killing people here. That's what is happening, Prince. Bro, there is no need to kill someone\nas everything is available with money. Bro, the place I come from\nis an artist's world. Your money doesn't rule there. Talent is the currency there. The world of sales and business\nhas polluted everything. I would just focus on my art now. And I would work at a place where\na fraud like Shishir isn't there. Bro, which world do you live in? People would gobble you. Do you think that you won't find Shishir\nor the insurance guy again? You fucking fool. Wherever you go, bro, Mumbai, theatre, film, love, relatives, you will find a new Shishir everywhere. Talent is the currency. Become capable\nand success will follow you. A fucking writer wrote it in an AC room\nwhile scratching his balls. Naive and cute boys and girls\nbelieved it. Do you know what happens in reality? In reality, the talented person\nis prepared to receive the trophy. Then comes the one who is half\nas talented as him. He humiliates the talented one badly. And asks him to clear his path\nas he is going to receive the trophy. He goes ahead and takes the trophy. The talented one stands at the back. He doesn't say anything or fight back. Why? Because that f**king fool tells himself\nthat he is deserving. Success will follow me. He keeps standing\nthere all his life, bro. You think like that. Because it's easy to snatch something. And it's easier to steal something. It's difficult to become deserving. Listen. There is a price to pay\nfor deceiving oneself as well. It comes all at once. And God settles all scores. You are cute, bro. Let's start the handover from tomorrow. Hey. It's Jimmy. Bro, I am shit-scared here. Your uncle is suspicious of me. Look, if you want to call me in future, then call me at Jatin's number\nor WhatsApp call me. Your uncle is impossible. He must be getting my calls recorded. He is Mr. R Rao. And this is his phone number. He chose a flat of 14 crore\nin Springfield Society. Those flats are listed in your company. The advance will come in a day or two. Bro, before that, pull the strings. Uncle, I can do that. But there is a problem. Oh no. There are too many problems\nalready. What happened now? Uncle, whatever deals we are snatching\nfrom uncle, they shouldn't be recorded under\nmy company or my name. And it's essential that someone else\nfaces the client from my company. Only then it's possible that uncle won't\nfind out that I'm connected to all this. And that's only possible if my boss is a marital pimp. So, is he not a marital pimp? I assumed that he is. But I am confused after having\na conversation today. Bro, one second. Please keep teaching me as well.\nWhat does a marital pimp mean? A big pimp. Look, bro. There are two ways to become big. First, become a big broker. -What does a broker mean?\n-A pimp. Second, become a sex worker. That means a sex worker\nof the highest order. And who is a sex worker? A prostitute. So, just like every other pimp,\nMr. Marital pimp's job is to earn money\nwhile someone else gets fucked. Like a politician. Big businessmen, high-class people,\npeople on top. But the sex worker would earn money but he would\nget fucked himself. A sex worker means\nthe middle-class people, lower-class, artists, retailers. So, what will you become? What do you mean by what he will become? Bro, we have to become a big pimp. Isn't that wrong? You earn the profits\nwhile someone else gets fucked. Whatever the sex worker is doing, he won't be guilty at least.  He would have his mental peace\nand self-respect. But the big pimp would have the world. So, to hell with mental peace. And f**k self-respect. Get it? Hello, brother Shishir. Yes. Yes. Okay, brother. Was that your boss? He was saying that he is a little shy. But he is a top-class pimp. Bro, congratulations. That's it. A little bit of commission\nshould come to me in huge suitcases. It will be amazing. Look at this as well. What if you don't get a job immediately? Do you have an emergency plan in place? I have some savings in my account. The household expenses\nand mom's expenses can be met for two to three months. You don't just have\nto meet your expenses. You had to plan properly\nand go to Mumbai. I told you a thousand times\nto do financial planning. If you get fired or fall sick is a part\nof the emergency planning as well. Emergency planning is not savings. Do you know who does savings? My grandma. You are more sensible\nthan my grandma, right? Come on. Take out your phone. Let's book a consultation call now\nwith the financial advisor. Chauhan, let me first get a job. I won't be able to invest anyway\nuntil I get a job. The advisor won't just make\nyou do investment planning. Prashant, this is your lucky stock.\nInvest your money in it. He would help you with\ncomplete financial planning. He would just get your financial data\nin the first call. About your investments, loans,\ninsurance, assets and liabilities. You would receive a financial score\naccording to that like a blood report. Then your advisor would explain\na financial plan to you. And then whatever deficiencies\nare identified in the blood report, according to that, the doctor suggests\nsupplements, exercises, etc. Your advisor will ask you to follow\nthree to four care action items. My dear brother. If you get the new job after a month\nor two or whenever, you can start planning now. So, I should book it on my phone? Yes, sir. Give it to me.\nI will book it for you. Hurry up. Give it to me. Your crowning ceremony for playing the main role will start\nonce the class begins. Right? Come on. Look at this here, bro. The app of 1 Finance. Is everyone here? -Yes, sir.\n-Yes, sir. So, let's start then. Keeping in mind the auditions\nthat took place yesterday, I am going to declare who is going\nto do the main role. You won't need this. So nervous about the result today, bro. I thought a lot about it last night\nand even this afternoon. So, keeping everything in mind, I have decided that the main role will be played by Samarth. -So, today,\n-Yes, man. -we will start with scene number 3.\n-Who will play the main role? I think everyone heard it. No, Pandit Ji, we heard it. But my performance was far better\nthan his. Prashant, I am the one to decide that. As I said that I need to take many things into\nconsideration apart from talent. No. Pandit Ji. I told you that I would\ncome before time. I would come at 5 if you say. -I would come in the morning if you say.\n-Look, Prashant, I thought a lot about\nmy decision and it's final. So, is that what you thought about! This boy from Splitsvilla\ndeserves this role more than me? More than me, Pandit Ji? Prashant, you can leave\ntoday's rehearsal. We will talk when you calm down\ntomorrow. Where is Ramesh?\nI asked for water a long time back. Pandit Ji, I will tell him. Come on. Do you know what happens in reality? In reality, the talented person\nis prepared to receive the trophy. Then comes the one who is half\nas talented as him. He humiliates the talented one badly. And asks him to clear his path\nas he is going to receive the trophy. And the talented one stands in a corner. And the other one goes\nahead and takes the trophy. No one else should know in the office. It should just be your regular builder\nclient for them. This is a big fraud. When the news goes public, there will surely be an investigation. I will push the sales team\nin my own way. And we won't sell 20 units. We will sell 50 units. Brother. Cheers. Let me buy you a drink.\nMake him a drink. Brother, I am thinking of meeting my dad today.\nSo, I can't drink. Are you scared of your dad? Only my dad. Brother, there is one more thing. There is a big dealer in Gurgaon. His name is Telka Kukreja.\nHe is my uncle. I have an insider in his firm. I get to know which client he is going\nto sell a property to beforehand. Brother, I want to bring these deals\nto our company. But if we want to play in the long run, brother, I would need a salesman\nwho could be the face of these deals. We will create a fake, dummy salesman\naccount and reflect the details there. You can pick anyone from the company\nto be the face of the deal. He will ask for a cut and that should go\nfrom your commission. Both of you have to earn that from\nthe client. -Done.\n-Done. And now, I hope you won't fire me and get me arrested. I told you that if you bring fraudulent proposals\nto me in the office, then I would fire you. But we are outside the office now. And outside the office, you become the big pimp. What? Tell me. You don't remember me at all. I can smell the chicken cooked by you. Let me taste it at least. Uncle Kapoor is here. Let's do it some other day, not tonight. I didn't elope with Uncle Kapoor's\ndaughter. I will also talk to him. Okay! -Give me bread at least.\n-It's not there. I only made four of them.\nTwo for Mr. Kapoor and two for me. I can do with just one bread. Son, go and get one for yourself. I hope there won't be a shortage\nof chicken. No. I cooked extra. You can have it. -Uncle, am I a fool?\n-What, son? Am I a fool? No, son. You are our darling son.\nWhy are you calling yourself a fool? Uncle, my mom left me long back. Then my younger brother\npassed away as well. I only have my father left who knows\nthe reason behind what I am doing. Isn't it his duty to ask me if everything is going fine? Is your work going fine?\nAre you doing fine? What does my dad tell me? Have chicken. I cooked extra. Have chicken if you want to\nor just go home. I am leaving. I just came to tell you that I set uncle's car on fire. The one he didn't allow\nbrother and you to sit in. Should I appreciate you? I burnt down a car worth 12.5 lacs. To exact revenge for your son\nand my brother. So, yes. Appreciate me. And feed me chicken and bread. Your uncle is a fraud. And you too have become a fraud\nto exact revenge on him. What should I appreciate you for? What should I say?\nThat you did a great job. Dad, I am at least doing something. I am doing something at least. I am not sitting home and drinking\nwhisky with chicken. I am at least exacting revenge for\nmy brother's death and our humiliation. I am at least doing something. Who would appreciate me? Who knows about this?\nThe one I am doing it for. And that's my father. Do you know why you are doing all this? You love money within. The revenge and the story\nthat you are narrating, you can say that to yourself. For earning money. Is mom asleep? You rascal. Do you have any shame left,\nyou scoundrel? Your mom's treatment is on\nand your dad is struggling. And you came home drunk. She fought with me to not call you\nas your practice must be going on. Is this your practice, you dog? You should just die out of shame. Who is it? Mom. Why did you get up and come here? I felt like talking to you.\nSo, I came here. You could have asked me to come. I was just going to come and see you.\nI thought that you must have slept. How do you feel? You wouldn't be feeling nice\nafter getting chemotherapy. Tell me how bad you are feeling. Everything is fine. You tell me. How is it going for you? Everything is going well for me. I am asking because nothing\nis going well. Tell me honestly. What shall I say? Everything is fine, mom. Honestly. You never invited me to your plays\nbut you must be good at acting. You are acting so well at home. When you found out about my condition, you were in Mumbai. Your film was about to start. I asked your dad multiple times\nnot to tell you about it. But he said, how can he not tell you\nas you are the only son? Then what I feared happened. You returned in two days. And since that day to date in 1.5 years, for the first time, you came to your room before seeing me. There must be something. Mom. It's nothing. Honestly. I don't say it to you. But I feel very bad that you\ngot stuck because of me. What can I do? If there was a button, then I would have switched it off\nand departed. I would have set you free. Do this. Let's go to your room. You are intoxicated with the therapy.\nYou are talking absurdly. I am intoxicated. Your dad was saying that someone else\ngot intoxicated today. I don't know Judo or Karate.\nI am not good with fancy words. But it would have been wrong\nif I could not see. If I knew the truth, I wouldn't be able to tell a lie. Who is that? That's the hero. I am not scared of the world\nmaking fun of me. They can get mad at me\nand choose not to talk to me. I am not scared of even dying. Who is immortal anyway? I am just scared that I might get tired and scared and think about my comfort\nor what's easy and pity myself with the thought\nthat I am undeserving and unlucky and get jealous of someone else's success and finally, give up on my dreams. Who is that? That's the hero. And I swear that I won't cry over my destiny\neven for a minute. I won't waste even a second\nwith wishful thinking. I will take what's mine rightfully\nfrom my destiny. God, how would I sleep peacefully by snatching someone else's right? I love living like a poet. And I also learnt that if I fight, I would be attacked right on my chest. Who is that? That's the hero. Hello? Do you want to earn 10 lacs in a month? I don't want to become immortal\nor a king or popular. Keep your worldly malicious\nways away from me. And I don't want to be known as a hero. -Who is that?\n-That's that hero. That's the hero.",

      "string": "Hey, let go of me. Who are you guys? What are you doing? Leave me. Hey, what are you doing to me?\nLet me go. Let me go. Run. Catch him. It's not the first time, right? We should have complained\nlong back, buddy. Listen, Prashant. Don't be afraid that if we complain\nagainst them, they'll get more angry. It's only because you\ndidn't speak up earlier that they have become more brazen. Prashant. Hence they did it again. And yet, you refuse to complain. Fearing your Principal at school and your parents at home. But what about out there? Out there, Prashant, there's no one\nwho will listen to you. Come on. Get up. On your feet. Come on, get up. Give me your belt. Go on. Take it off. You know, I know of a very talented cricketer who could not become a big cricketer. Because he missed a very important\nselection match. Only because of the fear that the boys he fought with\nthe previous day might have come back to bash him up. A girl couldn't become an IAS officer because at her coaching centre, some boys used to harass her. She compromised and gave up\nthe best coaching. Many such talented, hard-working, and intelligent kids, Prashant, are unable to fulfill their dreams. For the sole reason that they're unable to fight back. So now, even if you don't do\nthe dream-affirming exercise daily, what I am about to teach you now, you need to practice it daily. You can't fight for your dreams\nmerely with this. Nor with this. At times, you'll have to use this too. So, you won't come from now on? Anjali, seeing something wrong happening and being fully aware of it, either I won't allow it to happen or if I can't do anything about it,\nI won't stay there. Samarth doesn't deserve the part. Well, everybody knows that you\ndeserve the part. But you know, what's the bright side\nof this? Theatre is like a hobby for you. And your main focus is your job. Unlike me who is totally dependent\non theatre. There's a lot of pressure, you know. For instance, my only focus is on clearing some auditions or getting\na part. You know what I mean? You are in a safe space. What happened? Do you plan to move to Mumbai? For acting? Yes. I mean, opportunities in Delhi\nare so limited, right? I have given it a thought a few\ntimes though. But I haven't made up my mind yet. Do you plan to? In a year. For sure. So, you'll look for a job\nin Mumbai then? Anjali, acting is not a hobby for me. It's my sole purpose in life. I am working right now because\nI need the money. But I won't keep doing it for long. I see. In that case, it'll be a very difficult\ndecision for you to make. To quit your job and pursue\nacting full-time. -Right?\n-Aren't you also doing the same? Yes. But isn't it different for guys? In terms of responsibilities. I mean, aren't you scared? Of the expectations that your family\nmight have from you. I mean, unless you have a fixed income, how can you fulfill\nthose responsibilities? Right? I'm scared of a hell\nlot of things in life. But to quit everything and\npursue acting, this one thought has never scared me. But when something is very difficult and yet, you're convinced that\nyou can do it, it means it's a sign that it wants you\nto chase it. And who is that? Your destiny. Or perhaps, your stupidity. Just kidding. You remember the climax of the\nplay which Panditji had changed. After you leave the theater he has\nreverted back to the original climax. -Why?\n- Dont know. But everyone is guessing that\nit has something to do with you. What have you thought then? Look, I need the money. Desperately. But if we're inviting any trouble,\nthen tell me right now. Bro, a dealer always sells property\nto the client at a steep rate. If I sell the same property to\nthat client at a lesser price, then is it a sin? Why are you making me the face\nof the deal? Do the good deed yourself. Bro, this other dealer is my uncle. If he finds out that\nI'm stealing his deals, it will spoil our relationship.\nMy uncle and I are quite close. Moreover, he's a very emotional man. He will be heartbroken. Your uncle is dear to you. Yet, you want to slap him.\nBut you're using my hand for it. Bro, just go and ask around about\nTilakraj Kukreja. That person is so filthy rich that\neven for a gas and acidity problem, he books a bed for himself\nat a 5-star hospital. When you scratch down there, do you\ncare if you lose some hair? No, right? What we're stealing from\nmy uncle is only worth that much. And you'll give me a percentage of\nthe commission you'll get from there? No. There are already many takers\nfor that commission. Today, Shishir will make\nan announcement in the office. Rajkumar has gotten us a new builder client in Gurgaon. I want all of you to add this client\nto your selling inventory. Now, the builder has told us that if we\ndon't sell 20 units by this month end, he will replace us.\nI say let us sell 50 units. And show them why there's Lords\nat the end of our company's name. Now that you're on notice period,\nyou obviously won't be allowed to sell. But since the client is mine, you can deal with him directly\nwithout involving our company's name. But how will I strike the deals? Who will give me the leads? All the leads I get will be yours. I'll achieve my target anyhow. Now,\nwhether you sell in your notice period or after the notice period,\neven if you sell just five units, a good ten lacs will be all yours. You are my younger brother's namesake. Consider this a gift from an elder\nbrother to a younger brother. Let's get started then. Long live Grover uncle. -Hello, Mr. Rao.\n-Yes. Who is this? Mr. Rao, last night God appeared\nin my dream. And said that He wanted me\nto save your money. -Hello.\n-Almighty God. Please go on. I'm listening. Mr. Rao, you must've viewed a flat\nat the Springfield Society. This is the same property. I've already finalised it with\nKukreja's firm. -He is duping you, Mr. Rao.\n-What's your offer? He is giving it to you for 13.50, right? -How's 12.75?\n-You mean, they were going to screw me and leave me high and dry? All right. How do we go about it now? So, Mr. Rao, I'll get all\nthe paperwork done. And it's a done deal. Mr. Kukreja, that advance Mr. Rao was\nsupposed to send for that flat, he has flipped over now. What is he saying? Actually, sir, we had sold it to him\nat an added mark-up price. He found out somehow. Now, he's\nbuying it from some other agent. -He can go to hell.\n-I've a lead for the golf course flat. Sending you the number. This is where\nyour commission lies. Don't let it go. All right. Sir, I want to be a full-time actor.\nFor that, I need to move to Mumbai. Plus, I also need to take care of\nmy mother's treatment expenses. So, I just want to know how\nI can plan all this financially. Okay, Prashant. Let's start with your\nemergency planning and then go ahead. -Sonu.\n-One second, sir. -Yes, sir.\n-What's the update on the penthouse? That deal is already done, sir.\nWe're expecting the advance this week. Jimmy, the Rao deal commission,\nwhen are we expecting it to come? Take a chill pill, uncle.\nIt's on its way. Sir, I can get it for you for eleven. -Eleven?\n-Yes. They are duping you. Mister, I'm getting a better deal\nfrom someone else. -I see. Oh, really?\n-Actually, way better. Sorry. -But I'm booking the house through him.\n-Sir, hear me out at least. Bloody hell. Why don't I just\ncrush your skull right now? Jimmy, I swear, man. This scam\nthat I'm pulling for you, if your uncle gets a whiff of it, whenever he does, he's going to tie me\nnaked to his car and drag me around. And you know what's the best part?\nI won't get bored. Because even you will get dragged\nalong with me. Uncle, is there someone in your office\nmy uncle trusts the least? Yes, there's one douche. Why? Let's get you an insurance. Hello. Hello. Hey, RV. Hey, RV. My phone just conked off\nwhile I was talking to my wife. Can I have your phone?\nI need to call her. -You've memorized your wife's number?\nYou are being funny.! Now, come on. Give it to me. Can you hear me? Hello. Hello. Hello, Suman. Okay, listen, Suman. Don't cut the call. Hold the line.\nI'll call you back again. Okay, bye. Yes, hello. My friends are coming over\nthis evening. Make chicken for them. Okay. I'll get it on my way home. All right then. Do you need anything else?\nDo we have salt at home? Fine. Okay, then. Come on. Why are you\ngetting irritated now? Don't get angry over silly reasons.\nThank you. This boy, he has proved that you are limited\nonly by your desire. Because so far, just for this month, his bonus is twenty-two lacs. Sir, this is the third deal that has\ngot cancelled in the nick of time. Except Ram Vilas, Mr. Grover, I, and Mr. Singh, we've all lost\na deal each. And most importantly, all the three\ndeals have gone to the same company. I knew it. That's exactly what\nI was telling them. -Someone has been leaking information.\n-What's the name of the company? Property Lords. -Oh, Property Lords.\n-Mr. Kukreja, find out who the mole is. Whoever is leaking the information\nfrom our side, he is dead meat for sure. And the one taking all the information, he will be dead meat too. -Grover. Find out who the head of\nthis company is. -Yes. -Sure, sir.\n-Sir, I spoke to him two days ago. It's someone called Shishir. I did ask him as to why he was\nshoving his nose in our deals. But he started in English saying,\ndon't call me. I'll call the police. I said I'm calling from Mr. Kukreja's\noffice. Don't you know him? -Then?\n-Then he again blabbered in English. Tell Kukreja to **** himself. He cussed at you. I know, you pimp. I know\nit's a cuss word. Sorry, sir. So when he said, tell Kukreja to\n**** himself, what did you say to him? He just cut the call after saying that. But you must've called him\nback again, right? I'm sure you felt bad that he abused me. Yes, I did call him again.\nBut he didn't answer. Didn't answer. Okay. Had he answered your call, what would you have said to him? I would've given him an earful. I would've said, listen you wild dog.\nI will... He used some other cuss word\nin English for me, didn't he? Tell Kukreja to **** himself. Won't you also swear back at him\nin English? Which school did you go to? -Sir, Colonel Academy.\n-I see. Grover, isn't that an English\nmedium school? -Yes, sir.\n-Yes, it's an English medium school. So, it's an English medium school.\nThey're all agreeing to it. So, come on. Speak in English then. You listen. You dog. No respect. Some manners? Or I will teach. You dog. Who are you? Are you saying Mr. Kukreja **** himself?\nMr. Kukreja **** yourself. -Continue. Keep going. Dagar.\n-You... You *******. -Yes, sir.\n-Get a car full of our men. -We're going to Property Lords. Listen.\n-Okay, sir. -Get three cars with our men.\n-Okay, sir. It'll be done. -Go on.\n-You... You auntfucker. -You...\n-************? Sonu. Your late father must be hearing your English up there. And he must be reminiscing, how he broke his ass to pay your English medium school fees. He must be cursing himself. He must be telling God. O' God, please allow me to go down there\nonly for five minutes. I need to clobber my son 500 times\nin five minutes. On his face. You ********. Two days ago, a two-bit company's\ntwo-bit head cussed at me, Tilakraj Kukreja. And you pimp,\nyou're telling me this today? Do you have any idea how much he must\nhave cussed at me in two days? Come on. My humiliation aside, for your father's departed soul\nto be at peace, slap it on your face. Go on, do it. That's one for me. Now, for your father, 499 more. Without any break. Get started. How does it feel? What you would've earned\nin three months, you earned in just ten days. How do you feel earning in ten days\nwhat I earn in a year? This was just a six, bro. I'm aiming for a century now. Then I'll be at par with Sachin's\nhundred centuries. What can be at par with Sachin's\nhundred centuries? You'll know. My masterplan. Mission Money. What's mission money? First, you tell me. -What will you do with this money?\n-It's decided. My financial adviser has\ndrawn up a plan. First of all, I need to get\nlife insurance. -My family is dependent on me.\n-Okay. Then once I get the money, he has\nadvised me to put it in an FD. He has told me to increase\nmy emergency funds. That's it for now. After three months, he will\ntell me more. Why do you need a financial adviser? It's your money. Do what you want. Why do you need a coach then? You have\nthe bat. Hit wherever you want. You won't be able to, right? Expert coaching is needed in some\naspects of life. Why are all the guys\nnamed Prashant so cute? What happened to Prince? That moron didn't know how to\nride a scooter properly. He was driving dad back home\nfrom a wedding. And met with an accident. Who else is there in your family? My dad. And your mom? My dad killed her. What? That's what my uncle used to say. He still does. -Dagar.\n-Yes. -Find out who is Shishir here.\n-Yes. -Come out, mister. Just come out.\n-Who the hell are you? Look at him quizzing me. Tell me. -Dagar.\n-Yes, sir. -Give him a chair.\n-Have a seat, mister. No, it's okay. I'm fine here.\nTell me, what is it? When we're talking to you so politely,\nwhat's with this attitude of yours? Our boss is in a very good mood today. That's why he is being nice to you. Or by now, he would've first used his\nfists and kicks and then used words. Understood? Now, go and sit. Kavita, call security. Tell me. Oh, no. Why are you sitting there?\nYou should be here. Down here. No. I'm fine here. -Dagar. Make him sit here.\n-Yes, sir. Let's wrap it up quickly. So that everybody can go home on time. Make themselves a few drinks, have dinner and then go off to sleep. -My uncle says so.\n-But is it true? My mom had a stomach infection. We used to get unclean water\nwhere we lived. And to get her treated, my dad\ngot her admitted to a nearby clinic. The doctor wasn't good.\nBut he was cheap. Things took a bad turn. And mom died. Now, my uncle says that his sister died\nbecause my father was poor. And to be poor is one's own fault. What do you think? Is a man responsible for\nhis own poverty? If yes, then is my uncle right? That my father killed my mother. Is that why you want to be rich? Bro, cuss at me any way you want\nbut don't use the word, rich. But didn't you say you wanted to\nearn a lot of money? There's a difference, bro, between\nmaking money and being rich. Making money is like smoking\na cigarette. Addictive. But just like some smokers get cancer, some well-to-do people become rich. And let me tell you. Being rich is even\nworse than getting Cancer. Have you ever been around\nrich people, Prince? -Yes. I often meet such clients.\n-No, no. Not meeting. I'm talking about living. 24 hours a day. For eight years. I have. My brother and I have. My dad took us to him after\nour mom passed away. My uncle said, Get out of this\nsewer-like house. Come and live with me in Ameerpuri,\nDefence Colony. My sister's children will live in a good house. They'll go to an elite school. They'll grow up with rich kids. You know what's the best way to seek\nrevenge from a middle-class person? Leave him to survive in a neighbourhood\nof rich people. His soul will instantly die. Everything there would make you feel that you have a scarcity of everything. And you would feel\nas if you are invisible. And you are visible to no one. And if someone can see you, they don't take you as human. They take you as a living creature who\ncan work for you in exchange for money. That was my uncle's revenge for his sister's death. To my dad. And us. First of all, you took away\na few clients of mine. That too you were being too smart\nabout it. That's wrong. It won't happen after today. Say that you have understood it. Someone can gain business\nonly when someone loses it. That's the first rule of business. Look, brother. I will slap you at least a couple\nof times. That's what I had decided before coming\nhere if you agree with me nicely. If you don't listen to me, then it might go up to a thousand slaps. They are just numbers. And the numbers are infinite. Come on. Say it. Do it. Look, if I tell everyone that I won't take away their business like\nyou, then how would I run the business? -What's your name? Jaiprakash Hawana.\n-Jaiprakash. You need to shoot his family members. Can you do it, Jaiprakash? I shot the minister at your command. How much money will you take? As much as you like.\nPlease just take care of the diet. JP, you might go to jail as well. I am more than happy to go there. A\ncouple of my brothers are always there. They are comfortable there.\nWe will play Ludo nicely. Do you get it now? I don't even know him. He is willing to kill your family\nmembers at my command. The business will come and go.\n**** all this talk. Save all this talk for a businessman. I am a full-time goon. I am a part-time businessman. -Dagar, it looks like he understood it.\n-Yes, it seems so. Come on. Second of all, the information is getting leaked\nfrom my office and it's reaching you. Tell me his name. A salesperson got it. I will ask him and let you know. -Dagar, give him my phone number.\n-Yes. Okay. Call me by tonight and let me know. Come on. You are ready to receive the remaining\nslaps, right? -Dagar.\n-Yes. Will you slap him? Let it be. He will die if I slap him. What do you mean?\nHe will die if you slap him. But he won't die if I slap him.\nWhat is that supposed to mean? -Let's have a bet.\n-Okay. -Let's place a bet of 500 rupees.\n-Okay. It will be fun now. Move your head a little. Let it be. If he dies, who will call me? We can slap him anytime we want. By calling him to the office. Come to the office when we call you. Say that you got it. I got it. He got it. Look at him. Let's go. You got it? Well done. Let's go. No more cutting his deal from now on. And the one who is leaking\ninformation from his company, I need his name right now. To tell you the truth, you are getting scared for no reason,\nbrother. He is my uncle. I know him. He scared you as he wanted to do that. -He won't do anything more than that.\n-Listen. I don't get scared so easily. That man was sitting half a foot away from me\ntoday. And what I felt... Your uncle is pure evil. He meant every fucking single word\nhe said. Just do what I am asking you to do now. Give me the name of the contact. -I have a solution.\n-**** your solution. You have no ******* idea what took me\nto build this office. I left my home. I left my family\nand everything else. I could have taken your name\nbut I didn't. Now, give me the name of that contact. I can't do that. If I give you his name, he would get to know about me as well.\nAnd that can't happen. You didn't give away my name because I am your hen who lays golden eggs. You know that you won't get anything\nif you give me away. But slowly and gradually, there are infinite golden eggs. This is your commission for the 14 flats\nof the builder that we sold. 1 crore and 40 lac rupees. Brother, listen to my solution now. Just listen to my solution once. -Yes, dad. I was going to the site\nto meet a client. -Where are you? Come home now.\nDr. Khanna called from the hospital. He said that he needed to talk about\nthe PET scan they ran last week. Come soon. So, the PET scans that were done\nlast week, they are not looking good. The cancer cells have spread\nto the liver. Are they spreading? They should have reduced by now as the chemotherapy has\nbeen going on for so long. Yes, sure. That's always the aim. But chemotherapy doesn't work\nthe same way for everyone as expected. Sir, so do we have to get another\nsurgery down now? The surgery is not possible\nfor this, son. But you just said that the cells\nare spreading to the liver. We have to do something. We can do a second line of chemotherapy. But the probability is low. I don't get it. The probability\nis low for what? Take care of her. Spend as much time with her as possible. She has perhaps four to six months more. Dad. I will be back in two minutes. You always used to say\nthat you would call me when you play the lead role in the play. I will come this time. I have decided that I will\nwear a T-shirt in which it will written in bold, Hero's Mother. Sir, do you know that I have decided\nmy dream? Wow. That's amazing.\nWill you tell me now? I will become a hero when I grow up. I will take my mom to the movie\ntheatre to show her my film. Keep this dream safe. It won't be easy. I want to rejoin\nthe play again, Panditji. Yes. Sure. Why not? You are welcome. The actors have been finalized\nfor all the roles. You can join the backstage team. Panditji. Just one show. One show. The show which will take place first. I want to play the main role in that. What? Just one show, Panditji. Prashant, do you realise how stupid\nyou are sounding right now? No. You are not understanding, Panditji. Panditji, if my mom can't see me perform on the stage even for once, then all this is worthless to me. Mumbai. Films. Best actor in the world. All these things won't mean anything if my mom can't see me perform\non stage even for once. No. That's fine. Panditji. She doesn't have much time. Let me do the show which\nwill take place first. Should I ask the actor\nto give his role to someone else who has been practising it for so long? That's not fair. Well, do this. If you feel so, then try talking to Samarth once. It's fine if he agrees to it. I can't do anything personally. Panditji. I still can't believe how much money could there be in the envelope which could buy the conscience\nof a pure man. -Yes, uncle. -Jimmy, where are you?\nWhy weren't you answering the call? I have come to the washroom\nthrice in half an hour to talk to you. -What happened?\n-What would happen? Your uncle is holding everyone\ncaptive in the office. Till your boss sends the name of\nthe person who leaked the information. You spoke to your boss, right? Bro, I am really scared right now. Everything is okay, uncle. Have fun. Uncle will get the name. Along with the screenshot that you sent. This chapter will close right here. Grover. Yes. -Listen.\n-Yes, sir. -Shree.\n-Yes. Go home, all of you. -Driver.\n-Yes. Make RV lie down on the road\nand start the drill. He will be tied next to the car. Go. Don't kill him. You need to drive the car over his legs. You need to smash his knees. That's fine. We will smash them. It's our job to break bones. Daga, what are you saying?\nSir, I didn't do anything. Daga, leave me. Let go of me, Daga. -Daga, leave me.\nSir, I didn't do anything. -Come. -Sir.\n-Come. Let go of me, Daga. What are you doing?\nMr. Kukreja, I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything. I swear. Sir. Mr. Grover. Sir, let me go. Sir, I have kids at home. Daga, leave me. Samarth. Can we talk, bro? Do you want to talk to me? Yes, bro. Just two minutes, please. I will see you, babe. -Yes.\n-Jimmy, Kukreja came with his goons. He beat up uncle badly.\nHe got his legs broken. He found out that uncle was\ngiving you information. He is going to your place now. Bro, that doesn't make any sense. If you want her to see you perform, you can play any part. You're asking for a lead role. What does\nit have to do anything with your mother? It has everything to do with my mother. I want her to see my best\nwhen she sees me on stage. How does it impact people when her son performs on the stage? And that he can play the lead role. That I can do it. The lead role. Who is it? -Who is it?\n-Dad. -Uncle is coming.\n-Why? Let's leave right now. Why should I leave? It's my home. Oh, so, that which happens with every\nthief is happening with you. The fraud gets caught and the thief\nhas to escape. And his family along with him. No. I won't escape. Dad, after mom passed away, uncle called us to the defence colony\nto him. Then he gave the entire top floor to us. And made you a partner in his firm. He got my brother and me admitted\nto a nice school on Barakhamba Road. And he took everything back\nafter a year. So, you must have realised that uncle is not doing all this\nfor our betterment. He is doing all this to insult you. -So?\n-So, when you realized it after a year, why were we still there\nin the rich colony for eight years? I need an answer. I am sorry, bro. I understand. I can't let go of it so easily. My parents are also coming\nto watch the play, right? But maybe it will be the last time\nfor my mom. You know that you didn't earn this part. Your dad bought it for you. What did you say? Tell me, fucker. Say it again. I found out that you were an AD\nin the set of Imtiaz Ali. You didn't leave. You were asked\nto leave instead. Because you were disgusting in acting. Then comes the one who is half\nas talented as him. He humiliates the talented one badly. And asks him to clear his path\nas he is going to receive the trophy. The talented one moves aside.\nHe goes ahead and takes the trophy. The talented one stands at the back. He doesn't say anything or fight back. It's not your fault, bro. You are from this world. And this world is ******* mean. I didn't know how to become rich. I thought that maybe both of you will learn something in the company\nof rich people and become successful. It's fine then. We stayed with rich people. We learn how to loot. And how to be fraudulent. People are worth nothing. Yet, they  ****** show off. And I am becoming successful now. So, what's the problem? Dad, we stayed there for you. We learn it because of you. I don't understand what your problem is. Yes. That was my mistake. That place was not right.\nSo, we came back. So, we came back. So, it's fine. So, it's done. Forget those eight years now. So, should I forget those eight years? Dad. I was 14 years old and my brother\nwas nine. We washed dishes at our friend's place on his birthday. His mom made us wash them. Because she could see us two \"Bhikaari ke bacche\"  among those rich people. And we washed them by taking\n50 rupees for it. Because we had to go to the mall\nwith the same kids the next day. To have a burger. So, you tell me. Why shouldn't I earn money? And why shouldn't I exact revenge\non these rich people? And my  *******  uncle because\nof whom all this started. And why should my dad be upset with me? A father and his children's lives\nwere ruined because of a man. Would the father be happy if one of his sons becomes\nlike that man? Your uncle will talk nonsense\nand I will have to listen to it. I know that you have done something wrong. If you were right, I wouldn't have listened to your uncle\neven if he came with 50 goons. Son, a father feels most proud because of his child. And he loses that because of his child as well. Manan, you have forgotten the blocking.\nYou will be behind Samarth. So, he didn't agree, right? What will you do now? I waited all my life. That a miracle will happen to me too. But nothing good happened. I kept banging on the door but destiny kept denying me. And the magic happened when I became a magician myself. I waited all my life.\nThat a miracle will happen to me too. But nothing good happened. I kept banging the door\nbut destiny kept denying me. And the magic happened\nwhen I became a magician myself.",
