      "Will India's real estate market break all records in 2024? \nComment below and join the conversation.",
      "Because so many people overpaid for homes even while loan rates were low, I believe there will be a housing catastrophe because these people are in debt. If housing costs continue to drop and, for whatever reason, they can no longer afford the property and it goes into foreclosure, they have no equity since, even if they try to sell, they will not make any money. I believe that many individuals will experience this, especially given the impending mass layoffs and rapidly rising living expenses.",
      "The rising interest rate can surely control inflation, but won't prevent erosion of the eroding purchasing power of the US dollar. I have learnt my lesson this time. The banks can't be making money off my money, while inflation eats into it. I have set aside 650k to invest in the stock market now, since that keeps up with inflation, but I don't know how to get started.",
      "Real estate has become a mafia in India, middle class is unable to afford houses with no support from government most of the people will be homeless while rick corrupt people enjoy excess profits without paying any taxes",
      "As a canadian please do not allow realestate prices to continue to grow. It will screw over the younger generation and it will cause massive inflation.\n\nHousing should always be a place to live and an investment as a distant second!",
      "The best course of action if you lack market knowledge is to ask a consultant or investing coach for guidance or assistance. Speaking with a consultant helped me stay \tafloat in the market and grow my portfolio to about 65% since January, even though I know it sounds obvious or generic. I believe that is the most effective way to enter the business at the moment.",
      "For Gurgaon: 1.5 Cr is 1500sq.ft 2 BHK in upcoming areas.  Decent 3+ BHK (2100 sq ft) in new launch is 5 Cr+.  Central areas, it is costlier.   37% is out-of-pocket including govt. charges (non financeable).  1 recession and this will all come down crashing.",
      "Real estate boom is not necessarily a good thing.  It usually makes the housing less affordable.",
      "I don't know how well researched and real is this report. The reality is completely different, these are not the common people buying 5+cr flats , these are the big players buying.",
      "The real estate boom we see now is primarily being driven by  NRIs..for it's rental/resale value. I have cousins settled abroad who own 2-3 apartments each in India in prime locations and rented it out..one of the first investments for NRIs is real estate in India...It is becoming increasingly difficult for the middle class Indian to afford a 2BHK in metro cities..please don't say that middle class are driving the boom...how many middle class Indians are able to afford a 2bhk for 80 lacs, which is the price in an average Chennai suburb\n Nowadays the trend has shifted to buying of land\nThe real estate market is in the hands of politicians, NRIs and few wealthy Indians today...out of reach of middle class...the government has to do something to stop this",
      "If real estate goes above 15% of GDP, then the bubble will burst some day in the future.",
      "Ncr and bengaluru these two went crazy. Basically 2x in last 3 years. Ncr specially lot of black money is there. 7 cr appartment service class cannot afford, it basically translates to 4 lakh emi means your post tax income should be around 1 cr. Hardly any jobs pay so much.",
      "Go India. More powers to you from the Phil 🇵🇭🇮🇳\nI wish India/Bharat will be wealthier than China and become a superpower again someday just like in the ancient times.",
      "China is suffering because of Real estate sector. US 2008 recession was due to real estate sector, Collapse of Turkish Lira is caused by this real estate sector, Japan's lost decades of deflection happened after Plaza acccords which were caused by real estate prices surging....\n\nIn other words this is the industry that kills every nation through debt, and now its India's turn.",
      "As she mentioned correctly, in Pune the growth is crazy !! Any highway you drive along in Pune, there are 20-25 storied high buildings getting built . Porsches, G wagons now literally going past my street almost everyday. The BMWs, Mercs, Audis are like crazy high in numbers !! The fancy French, Italian Restaurants full . Louis Vuitton stores in the mall with customers spending well above 7-8k rupees. Just a fantasy coming true. But all of this while still having bad city roads and lack of basic ammenities like Footpaths, proper garbage collection and management. Utter Disappointment even after developing leaps forth. One good thing that Local Govt. did was getting the Metro to Pune. Atleast now everybody can get to their destination sustainably and without any hassle.",
      "Awesome God bless India.",
      "Good job India! Just don't let your real estate market end up like China's.",
      "Im from hyderabad,  were a midde class family. we have couple of houses whose land value has increased significantly. Now we're still middle class bc our salary and inflation prices are high. So to people who are assuming that having 1 crore or 1 M dollars is rich? You're absolutely wrong. House is not for sale and new house would cost crores. So we're still middle class just the numbers changed. We still can't afford anything luxurious and we dont live in posh locality.",
      "Real estate grown at 5.8% CAGR in last 10 years. Slowdown already hit tech sector. Yes manufacturing and business is thrilling but that will impact business cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Tech slowdown and layoff of lakhs will be clearly seen in Pune, Hyderabad and Bengaluru real estate. Yes flat sales were 2 Lakh+ in seven major cities. But this is still pent up demand post covid. People are not preferring real estate for investment because they knew 1 crore flats will not get sold in 2 crore easily! Home loan rates are still high and without interest rate decrease real estate will continue to have challenges.\nIf black money is taken out of the system real estate will become affordable. Projection are not the reality. Even in 2010, agencies predicted that by 2020 real estate will grow in double digit CAGR. They are heavily influenced.",
      "Without a doubt, this video is a real estate sponsored production. Finally Firstpost is no exception."

      "string": "this year an Indian realy major made an announcement its latest luxury residential project was ready it was located in gurugram in India's national capital region the project opened for pre-sale and within 72 hours it was sold out we are talking about 1,113 luxury Flats valued at 7,200 CR rupees all laed up in just 3 days in India buying a house is a big deal a social right of passage an emotional experience and a guarantee of Financial Security there's also a lot of sentimental value attached but is this sentiment alone driving India's real estate market or are there other forces at play 2023 was a bumper year for Indian real estate will 2024 be bigger and better that's what we'll discuss tonight hello and welcome I'm py Sharma and this is between the lines [Music] Our Story begins with India's independence here was a nation that had been looted and plundered for centuries now free of occupiers trying to rebuild itself so the focus was on accessibility not luxury AKA public housing projects the government launched many of them all over the country then came the land reforms of the 50s and 6s land was redistributed the next big shift came in the 1980s that's when private housing entered the market and with liberalization in the 1990s it grew further large scale projects came up your it Parks shopping malls big budget housing cut to 2024 India's real estate market is among the fastest growing in the world and it's evident if you live in an Indian Metro City go out and look around the cultures may be different the language may be different the food habits may be different but there's one thing you'll find everywhere skyscrapers and cranes the droning noise of construction is deafening but it's also defining every major Indian city in 2023 India's real estate market was worth around $265 billion by 2030 it will be worth $1 trillion and by 2047 5.8 trillion that is the projection imagine that a 12-fold rise between 2023 and 2047 which means a lot will change currently real estate contributes to 7% of India's GDP it employs over 50 million people cement steel glass all of these industries depend on real estate by 2047 it could make up for more than 15% of the country's GDP it will be a mammoth sector and the trends are clear in 2022 homes worth 3.27 lakh CR rupees were sold the next year it went up to 4 and a half lakh crores that's a 38% rise in just one year so the demand is strong but where are these people investing India has 7 top residential markets Mumbai Delhi NCR bangaluru Hyderabad Chennai Kolkata and Pune essentially the country's biggest cities and last year these cities sold a lot of houses more than 476,000 units in one year a 31% increase since 2022 so what's driving this surge a lot of factors but the biggest one is India's economy it is shining in an otherwise gloomy Global picture growth has been stable the fundamentals are strong India's central bank has not hied interest rates all of this has driven up demand plus with the economy India's middle class is also Rising they're earning more they have more disposable income and they're investing in real estate the government supports this it wants real estate to Boom so it's offering incentives there are tax reductions subsidies for for buyers and schemes for affordable housing but it's not just affordable that Indian buyers are seeking a lot of them also want luxury premium properties now first things first what defines luxury real estate in India it's typically anything priced over 1.5 CR rupees if you're in Mumbai it's anything above 2 and a half crores that's luxury these properties have a few defining factors they're in Prime neighborhoods they have amenities there's topnotch infrastructure state-of-the-art fitness centers infinity pools rooftop lounges coner Services shopping centers it's this attention to detail that makes them appealing and the rich want them in the first 6 months of 2023 the sale of luxury homes jumped by 130% it was 3,000 units in 2022 6,900 units in 2023 that's a 130% rise then there's Ultra luxury homes that's real estate priced at over 40 CR rupees last year sales for that Rose by 200% almost 600 such homes were sold in India's top Seven Cities the numbers may sound too good to be true but it's not happening out of the blue there have been signs and one of them is India's Rising affluent demographic by 2027 the number of millionaires in the country set to increase by 69% then there are the ultra high net worth individuals people with a net worth of $30 million and more in the next 3 years India will have at least 9 18,000 ultra high net worth individuals they want affluent Lifestyles and the first thing they want is luxury real estate and it's not just housing that's picking up there's demand for other segments as well I'm talking about your office spaces co-working spaces malls all of them have seen an uptick in sales also industrial spaces your warehouses dark stores demand for those is also Rising growing e-commerce businesses are fueling it and investors are tracking this surge in including foreign investors they want to invest in India's real estate in the first half of 2023 more than 4 billion dollars flowed into India this was in the form of private credit and half of it went to real estate so foreign investors want to invest here and they're dumping China for it China's property Market is going through a slump debt is piling companies are shutting shop and the middle class is battered foreign investors or any investors for that matter do not like such volatility so they're turning to India here they get a growing economy a favorable demographic and a stable government it's almost an easy choice and it's working out for in India's favor so to sum it up more people are buying houses more houses are being built foreign money is pouring it and it all looks very good but no success story is without challenges and India's real estate story has its own share of challenges the first is the cost of land it is rising across the country India is now the 14th priciest residential real estate market globally which means affordable Solutions are few and far between it's not like everyone can afford a 1 and a half CR rupee house then there are bureaucratic processes you find an affordable plot of land you want to buy it but you'll have to jump through hoops the red tape can be daunting plus there are legal challenges 16% of all properties are embroiled in some or the other legal case and then there's the issue of loans most buyers cannot pay for the full price of their house so they take loans it's a tedious process especially when you don't know when you'll get possession of your property it can often take years Builders can go bust buildings can be left under construction and all the while you pay high interest rates and property taxes so there's a lot to discourage people a lot that needs to be fixed having said that the sentiment Still Remains positive real estate is booming in India and it's it's expected to continue to grow in the years to come it's also a reflection of India's journey of a country where dreams are built and realized one brick at a [Music] time that",

      "this year an Indian realy major made an announcement its latest luxury residential project was ready it was located in gurugram in India's national capital region the project opened for pre-sale and within 72 hours it was sold out we are talking about 1,113 luxury Flats valued at 7,200 CR rupees all laed up in just 3 days in India buying a house is a big deal a social right of passage an emotional experience and a guarantee of Financial Security there's also a lot of sentimental value attached but is this sentiment alone driving India's real estate market or are there other forces at play 2023 was a bumper year for Indian real estate will 2024 be bigger and better that's what we'll discuss tonight hello and welcome I'm py Sharma and this is between the lines [Music] Our Story begins with India's independence here was a nation that had been looted and plundered for centuries now free of occupiers trying to rebuild itself so the focus was on accessibility not luxury AKA public housing projects the government launched many of them all over the country then came the land reforms of the 50s and 6s land was redistributed the next big shift came in the 1980s that's when private housing entered the market and with liberalization in the 1990s it grew further large scale projects came up your it Parks shopping malls big budget housing cut to 2024 India's real estate market is among the fastest growing in the world and it's evident if you live in an Indian Metro City go out and look around the cultures may be different the language may be different the food habits may be different but there's one thing you'll find everywhere skyscrapers and cranes the droning noise of construction is deafening but it's also defining every major Indian city in 2023 India's real estate market was worth around $265 billion by 2030 it will be worth $1 trillion and by 2047 5.8 trillion that is the projection imagine that a 12-fold rise between 2023 and 2047 which means a lot will change currently real estate contributes to 7% of India's GDP it employs over 50 million people cement steel glass all of these industries depend on real estate by 2047 it could make up for more than 15% of the country's GDP it will be a mammoth sector and the trends are clear in 2022 homes worth 3.27 lakh CR rupees were sold the next year it went up to 4 and a half lakh crores that's a 38% rise in just one year so the demand is strong but where are these people investing India has 7 top residential markets Mumbai Delhi NCR bangaluru Hyderabad Chennai Kolkata and Pune essentially the country's biggest cities and last year these cities sold a lot of houses more than 476,000 units in one year a 31% increase since 2022 so what's driving this surge a lot of factors but the biggest one is India's economy it is shining in an otherwise gloomy Global picture growth has been stable the fundamentals are strong India's central bank has not hied interest rates all of this has driven up demand plus with the economy India's middle class is also Rising they're earning more they have more disposable income and they're investing in real estate the government supports this it wants real estate to Boom so it's offering incentives there are tax reductions subsidies for for buyers and schemes for affordable housing but it's not just affordable that Indian buyers are seeking a lot of them also want luxury premium properties now first things first what defines luxury real estate in India it's typically anything priced over 1.5 CR rupees if you're in Mumbai it's anything above 2 and a half crores that's luxury these properties have a few defining factors they're in Prime neighborhoods they have amenities there's topnotch infrastructure state-of-the-art fitness centers infinity pools rooftop lounges coner Services shopping centers it's this attention to detail that makes them appealing and the rich want them in the first 6 months of 2023 the sale of luxury homes jumped by 130% it was 3,000 units in 2022 6,900 units in 2023 that's a 130% rise then there's Ultra luxury homes that's real estate priced at over 40 CR rupees last year sales for that Rose by 200% almost 600 such homes were sold in India's top Seven Cities the numbers may sound too good to be true but it's not happening out of the blue there have been signs and one of them is India's Rising affluent demographic by 2027 the number of millionaires in the country set to increase by 69% then there are the ultra high net worth individuals people with a net worth of $30 million and more in the next 3 years India will have at least 9 18,000 ultra high net worth individuals they want affluent Lifestyles and the first thing they want is luxury real estate and it's not just housing that's picking up there's demand for other segments as well I'm talking about your office spaces co-working spaces malls all of them have seen an uptick in sales also industrial spaces your warehouses dark stores demand for those is also Rising growing e-commerce businesses are fueling it and investors are tracking this surge in including foreign investors they want to invest in India's real estate in the first half of 2023 more than 4 billion dollars flowed into India this was in the form of private credit and half of it went to real estate so foreign investors want to invest here and they're dumping China for it China's property Market is going through a slump debt is piling companies are shutting shop and the middle class is battered foreign investors or any investors for that matter do not like such volatility so they're turning to India here they get a growing economy a favorable demographic and a stable government it's almost an easy choice and it's working out for in India's favor so to sum it up more people are buying houses more houses are being built foreign money is pouring it and it all looks very good but no success story is without challenges and India's real estate story has its own share of challenges the first is the cost of land it is rising across the country India is now the 14th priciest residential real estate market globally which means affordable Solutions are few and far between it's not like everyone can afford a 1 and a half CR rupee house then there are bureaucratic processes you find an affordable plot of land you want to buy it but you'll have to jump through hoops the red tape can be daunting plus there are legal challenges 16% of all properties are embroiled in some or the other legal case and then there's the issue of loans most buyers cannot pay for the full price of their house so they take loans it's a tedious process especially when you don't know when you'll get possession of your property it can often take years Builders can go bust buildings can be left under construction and all the while you pay high interest rates and property taxes so there's a lot to discourage people a lot that needs to be fixed having said that the sentiment Still Remains positive real estate is booming in India and it's it's expected to continue to grow in the years to come it's also a reflection of India's journey of a country where dreams are built and realized one brick at a [Music] time that"

      "Sir, property prices are out of 90% Indians peoples reach. The bussinesses profits, salaries and interests are not increases n property owners wants their money double at every 5 years. Some people make it full time bussiness of common peoples basic needs. The govt. have only interest in earning tax from properties. The paradox should fall at time of covid but any how builder n govt. lobby keep it stable but manipulation can't hide the truth. The overhyped blood sucking money of common people will not grow more time. I can clearly see people are afraid to buy houses at highly inflated prices.",

बात करें या फिर स्मॉल सिटीज की बात करें तो यहां पे देखने को मिल रहा है कि एकदम मार्केट के अंदर रियल स्टेट के अंदर काफी बूम देखने को मिला है काफी सोल्ड आउट हो जाते हैं प्रॉपर्टी मिल नहीं रही है और ओवर

या फिर अगर हमें फॉर्मिंग लैंड लेनी है तो उसके कॉरस्पॉडिंग हमें क्या करना चाहिए तो आशीष जी सबसे पहले तो आप मुझे यह बताएं कि जैसे मैं कोई भी चीज खरीदने जा रहा हूं रियल एस्टेट से रिलेटेड तो वह काफी इन्फ्लेट है तो उसका क्या रीजन है और यह जो जंप देखने को मिला है एकदम तो इसके पीछे क्या रीजंस है क्यों जंप हुआ है ये देखो रीजन सबसे पहले समझना होगा हो तभी हम समझ पाएंगे कि यह जो आपको अप मूव देखने को मिला है रियल एस्टेट में पहले प्लॉट्स में था फिर उसके बाद फ्लैट में आया है तो ये कब तक रहेगा और कहां पर आपको करेक्शन देखने को मिल सकती है किस साल में देखो मैं अगर बात करूं 2012 में ऐसा बूम देखने को मिला था उसके बाद एक लंबी मंदी के बाद रियल एस्टेट में अब फिर से डिमांड आनी शुरू हुई है और वो हुई है कोरोना काल के बाद उसके पीछे दो ही रीजन थे कि लोग वर्क फॉर्म के चक्कर में वापस अपने घर चले गए थे

ऑफिस तो पहले रेंटल की डिमांड बड़ी थी रेंटल आसमान छू रहे हैं विने जी रेंटल के बाद लोगों ने कहा कि हमें अपना घर खरीदना चाहिए तो वहां से प्रॉपर्टी की डिमांड शुरू हुई पहले आपके प्लॉट बढ़े उसके बाद फ्लैट

लिक्विडिटी डिमांड जनरेट हुई आगे उसको इन्वेस्ट करने की तो वो बड़े शहरों से छोटे शहरों की तरफ भी रुख हुआ जमीन की अगर हम बात करें तो वो रीजन था नोटबंदी और लोगों का घर वापस आना तो यह एक और काफी समय से

नहीं कितना ज्यादा रेट होगा तो इस वजह से आपको रियल सेक्टर में एकदम से बूम आते हुए देखने को मिला है और नए नए डेवलपर्स भी सामने आए जैसे 2012 में भी आए थे विन जी नए नए डेवलपर्स अब आपको सामने आते हुए देखने को मिलेंगे जो कि नए लॉन्च लेक आएंगे बेहिसाब प्राइस प भी होंगे तो आपको अवेयरनेस और रिस्क कॉशस अप्रोच भी अपनानी है वो भी आपके लिए इंपोर्टेंट रहेगा जी तो आशीष जीब मेरे को फॉर एग्जांपल जैसे 2024 आ ही रहा है तो मुझे प्लॉट की तरफ जाना चाहिए या फिर फ्लैट की तरफ जाना चाहिए फ्लैट्स की अवेलेबिलिटी तो काफी होती है बट फ्लैट्स बहुत ज्यादा हैं तो आपकी नजर में फ्लैट वर्सेस प्लॉट अगर हम बात करूं तो आपकी कौन सा ज्यादा मुझे रिटर्न दे सकता है देखो जमीन कम हो रही है विनय जी सब जगह पर चाहे मेट्रो सिटीज की बात कर लो या छोटे शहरों में बात कर लो पहले छोटे शहरों की बात कर लेते हैं जो कि टायर टू टायर सिटी रहती है लुधियाना की बात करें या हरियाणा के कुछ पर्टिकुलर सिटीज की बात करें साउथ में किसी पर्टिकुलर सिटी की बात करें अभी तो सब जगह पर बूम था मुझे लगता है कि वहां पर ये खत्म हो चुका है और ज्यादा मेरे को प्राइज एस्केलेशन की उम्मीद नहीं है क्योंकि छोटे शहरों में ऐसा नहीं है कि विन जी लोगों के पास बाइंग कैपेसिटी बहुत ज्यादा हो आप क्या अनुमान लगाते कि छोटे शहरों में दो करोड़ तीन करोड़ चार करोड़ से ऊपर क्या कोई प्लॉट खरीदेगा या घर खरीदेगा तो मुझे लगता और वहां पर लोन की अगर हम बात करें फाइनली कुछ लोग लोन प भी घर खरीदते हैं तो उनकी सिविल स्कोर को भी अगर आप देखो उनकी टोटल इनकम को भी देखो तो मुझे लगता है कि वो पोटेंशियल उनका खत्म हो चुका होगा तो वहां पर अभी आपको थोड़ा ठंडा माहौल भी देखने को मिल रहा होगा और नए फर्द हाईक प्राइस में नहीं देखने को मिले हो और वहां पर ज्यादातर लोग प्लॉट में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं फ्लैट में नहीं करते हैं तो वहां पर मुझे थोड़ी रिकव देखने को मिलती है तो वहां पर तो मैं कहूंगा कहीं भीभी इन्वेस्ट ना करें एक कहा भी जाता है कि बाय व्हेन पीपल आर इन फियर और सेल व्हेन पीपल आर इन ग्रीड तो जब लालच का माहौल होता है कि मैं छूट जाऊंगा तो उस समय पर तो आपको चीजें बेचनी चाहिए और जब कोई नहीं खरीद रहा होता है तो वही समय होता है पैसा वही लोग बनाते हैं जो कि डर के माहौल में अपना इन्वेस्टमेंट करते हैं जब कोविड के टाइम प कोई नहीं खरीद रहा था जिन जिन्होंने इन्वेस्टमेंट की चाहे इक्विटी में की हो चाहे रियल एस्टेट में की होगी आज वो अच्छा प्रॉफिट कमा के बैठे हैं यहां से कोई खरीदेगा तो पता नहीं कि कितना प्रॉफिट कमाए प्लॉट की अगर हम बात करें विने जी प्लॉट का सिर्फ और सिर्फ एक ही ट्रिगर है एनसीआर रीजन की अगर मैं बात करूं हरियाणा की स्पेसिफिकली बात करूं या गुड़गांव की बात करूं तो अभी प्लॉट के ऊपर फोर्थ फ्लोर को बैन किया गया है ऐसा अनुमान लगाया जा रहा है कि जहां पर भी सड़क की लेंथ 9 मीटर है या पुराने सेक्टर है 12 मीटर है वहां पर शायद आपका फोर्थ फ्लोर ना आए दिन दियाल में तो चांसेस कम लगते हैं पर हां जहां पर प्लॉट का लोकेशन 24 मीटर रोड प है या बड़ी रोड के ऊपर है बड़ा साइज का प्लॉट है 250 स्क्वा यार्ड से ज्यादा है तो प्लॉट आपके लिए हमेशा इन्वेस्टमेंट पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से बेटर रहता है तो प्लॉट आपके कम भी हो रहे हैं या नए लॉन्च नहीं हो रहे हैं तो इन्वेस्टमेंट पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से प्लॉट बेटर है और आपको खुद रहना है रहने के हिसाब से फ्लैट सबसे अच्छा रहता है क्योंकि वहां पर आप जो एमिटी आपको मिलती है तो उसका आप चुनाव करते हैं और माई वन कंस्ट्रक्शन अभी काफी ज्यादा पॉपुलर हो रही है तो नया अगर आपको इन्वेस्टमेंट करना है नए घर में अगर आपको कंस्ट्रक्शन लिंक प्लान के साथ जाना है तो मावन कंस्ट्रक्शन में जाएंगे तो आपके लिए अच्छा रहेगा जी तो आशीष जी अब यहां पर बात कर लेते हैं कि जैसे यह मार्केट बूम कर रही है रियल स्टेट की क्या यह कुछ महीने रह सकती है क्या यहां पर फसने के चांसेस है या क्या यह हाउसिंग बबल की तरह ट्रीट किया जाए कि हाउसिंग मार्केट क्रैश हो सकती है यहां पे तो और कई कई लोग ऐसे सोचते हैं कि मार्केट बूम कर रही है मैं इन्वेस्ट कर दूं बट वही 2015 2016 की हालत ना हो जाए कि मार्केट बिल्कुल एकदम बिल्कुल कोई लेने को तैयार नहीं था तो उस केस में आपकी क्या र रहेगी कि क्या यहां पे हाउसिंग करेक्शन देखने को मिल सकती है बिल्कुल देखने को मिलती है विनय जी ये डर का माहौल अभी नहीं है लोग अभी फियर ऑफ मिसिंग आउट के चक्कर में या शॉर्ट टर्म में प्रॉफिट कमाने के चक्कर में लोग इन्वेस्ट कर रहे हैं और एक दिन में ही अगर आप देखेंगे पूरे के पूरे फ्लैट बिक जाते हैं पर ये एक खतरे की घंटी भी है दो जो 2012 में ऐसा बूम देखने को मिला था वैसा मुझे लगता है कि अगले छ महीने 9 महीने रह सकता है बट उसके बाद हो क्या रहा है विन जी ये समझना है काफी लोग फ्लैट लॉन्च कर रहे हैं अभी आप 10 पर दो बाकी आप पोजीशन पे देना अभी आप 30 पर दो बाकी आप सुपर स्ट्रक्चर के टाइम पे देना तो लोगों को यह मतलब नहीं है कि हम बाद में पैसा कब लेके आएंगे लोग क्या कर रहे हैं अभी 30 पर अपना पैसा दे रहे हैं और सोच रहे हैं कि बाद में जब प्रीमियम आएगा उसको बेच के निकल जाएंगे हो सकता है कुछ लोग ऐसा पैसा बना भी ले बट फाइनली जब एंड यूजर की मार्केट आएगी जब ये फियर ऑफ मिसिंग आउट का माहौल खत्म होगा या जब इनकी नेक्स्ट इंस्टॉलमेंट आएगी सुपरस्ट्रक्चर जो कि मुझे लगता है कि दो साल अभी दूर है दो साल के बाद जब वो सिचुएशन आएगी जब दोबारा बिल्डर पैसा मांगेगा उस समय लोग सप्लाई लेके आएंगे कि मेरा मुझे प्रीमियम आपको एग्जांपल देता रीजन गुरुगांव का एक प्रोजेक्ट था डीएलएफ का ही डीफ अल्मा वहां पर लंचिंग काफी अच्छे प्राइस प हुई थी 9500 के आसपास के हुई थी लोगों ने भर भर के पैसा लगाया था और बाद में वो डिस्काउंट पर भी की थी क्योंकि जब इशू आने शुरू हुए इंस्टॉलमेंट आनी शुरू हुई तो लोगों के पास पैसा नहीं आपको क्या लगता है विने जी 4 करोड़ 5 करोड़ के जिस तरीके से फ्लैट बिक रहे हैं आपको क्या लगता है कि लोगों के पास इतनी लोन की कैपेसिटी है या उनके पास वाइट मनी इतनी है जो वो दे पाएंगे हो सकता है कि एनआरआई जो बाय कर रहे हैं वो उतना सप्लाई कर पाए पर फाइनली एंड यूजर की इसको मार्केट को बनना है इन्वेस्टर्स को बाहर आना है और जब ये नेक्स्ट इंस्टॉलमेंट आएगी सुपरस्ट्रक्चर की कंप्लीट होने की या नेक्स्ट आपके पास जब जेब से 60 पर पैसा जाएगा तो लोग उसको बेचने निकलेंगे और जब सप्लाई आएगी तो बिल्कुल यहां से करेक्शन देखने को मिलेगी जिस तरीके से प्राइस बढ़ रहे है हां कुछ बेल्ट में हो सकता है आपको फायदा हो अभी नया एयरपोर्ट खुला है ग्रेटर नोडा में तो वहां पर एक प्राइस बूम समझ आता है द्वारका एक्सप्रेसवे बड़ा है वहां पर एक प्राइस एप्रिसिएशन समझ आता है पर 20000 के भाव पर मुझे समझ नहीं आता पर स्क्वायर फीट प हां 10000 का जिस सिचुएशन से मार्केट चल रही है वो एक रीजनेबल प्राइस मुझे दिखता है अयोध्या में प्रॉपर्टी के प्राइस बड़े वो समझ आता है पर कितना बढ़ेगा कितना प्राइस एक एप्रोप्राइटिंग आने वाला है 2024 में नहीं पर 2025 में तो मुझे दिखता है क्रैश रियल एस्टेट सेक्टर में तो कोशिस अप्रोच अपनाए एंड यूजर फाइनली फंस जाते हैं अभी ये इन्वेस्टर मार्केट है यहां पर रोज वो प्राइस बढ़ा रहे हैं सोच रहे हैं कि आज मैं थोड़ा पैसा डालूं और वहां से अपना रेट ऑफ रिटर्न जो है जो आरओ आई की बात करें हम तो वो वो उनको ज्यादा अच्छा दिखता है कम पैसा लगा के बट जब डिमांड आएगी उसके बाद यहां पर बिल्कुल आपको करेक्शन देखने को मिलेगी तो कॉशस अप्रोच लगाए किस पर्पस के लिए आप इन्वेस्ट कर रहे हैं अगर आप एंड यूजर है तो एंड यूजर के हिसाब से अपना घर खरीदें एक घर खरीदें फ्लैट की अगर हम बात करें बाकी इन्वेस्टमेंट के बिने जी बहुत सारे हरिजन है आपके लिए क्यों इतना रिस्क लेना है बड़े अमाउंट का रिस्क लेना है बाकी आप धीरे-धीरे अपना बाकी हरिजन में अपना इन्वेस्टमेंट कर सकते हैं अब जाते जाते बात करते हैं कि अगर मैं हील स्टेशन की बात करूं वहां पर भी काफी ज्यादा इन्वेस्टमेंट्स देखने को मिली है तो आपकी क्या राय रहेगी कि वहां पर इन्वेस्टमेंट करना कितना सही रहेगा देखो वहां पर लोगों का बिल्कुल बकल रुझान बड़ा है और जिस तरीके से ग्लोबल वार्मिंग हो रही है और एनसीआर रीजन की अगर मैं विन जी बात करूं जिस तरीके से पोल्यूशन है तो बिल्कुल हील स्टेशन के पास आप प्रॉपर्टी में इन्वेस्ट कर सकते हैं काफी लोग वहां पर अट्रैक्ट भी हो रहे हैं वहां पर आपको अच्छा मुनाफा हो सकता है पर ध्यान क्या रखना है वहां पर कुछ ऐसी जमीन भी होती है जो कि थोड़ा सा नीचे की तरफ है या पहाड़ खिसक जाते हैं तो वो आप थोड़ा सा ध्यान ले वहां पर अगर आपका कोई लोकल रिलेटिव या फ्रेंड है उसी से समझे कि किस जगह पर ऐसा ना हो कि आप बिल्कुल पहाड़ पे लैंड खरीद ले जैसे जोशी मट की बात करें या कुछ जगह पर लैंड स्लाइड भी देखने को मिली है या जमीन खिसक रही है तो ध्यान रखें कि हिल स्टेशन में आप कहां बाय कर रहे हैं देहरादून एक अच्छी अपॉर्चुनिटी है क्योंकि वो थोड़ा सा फ्लैट प आपका आ जाता है बाकी बिल्कुल मेजर हिल स्टेशन प लेने से बचे और आपको ये भी देखना है हिल स्टेशन प अगर आप रहने भी जाते हैं तो वहां पर एमिटी क्या मिल रही है हॉस्पिटल्स भी है कि नहीं है वहां पे अच्छे स्कूल है कि नहीं है क्योंकि देहरादून का मैंने एग्जांपल क्यों दिया वहां पर अच्छे स्कूल्स भी है हॉस्पिटल्स भी है तो वहां पर और दिल्ली देहरादून की काफी अच्छी सिक्स ले हाईवे बनने वाला है तो वो कनेक्टिविटी आपकी अच्छी होने वाली है तो देख और सोच समझ के करें अ लैंड का बिल्कुल देखें कि किस तरह की आप लैंड खरीद रहे हैं रियल एस्टेट प्लॉट तो बिल्कुल विन जी ओवर ए लॉन्ग टर्म आपको अच्छा रिटर्न बिल्कुल देता है तो इन्वेस्टमेंट के लिए प्लॉट में ही इन्वेस्ट करें वो ज्यादा अच्छा रहता है",

      "2024 के अंदर रियल स्टेट मार्केट कैसा करेगी आज आशीष जी से डिस्कस करेंगे सभी सिटी के बारे में बात करेंगे पुणे बेंगलोर मुंबई या फिर दिल्ली एनसीआर की अगर हम बात करें या फिर हिल स्टेशन की बात करें या फिर स्मॉल सिटीज की बात करें तो यहां पे देखने को मिल रहा है कि एकदम मार्केट के अंदर रियल स्टेट के अंदर काफी बूम देखने को मिला है काफी सोल्ड आउट हो जाते हैं प्रॉपर्टी मिल नहीं रही है और ओवर प्राइस मिल रही है क्या यह हाउसिंग बबल हो सकता है क्या यहां से मार्केट क कर सकती है अगर हम रियल स्टेट की बात करें या फिर यहां पर और बूम देखने को मिला है क्या करना चाहिए 2024 के अंदर फ्लैट वर्सेस प्लॉट या फिर अगर हमें फॉर्मिंग लैंड लेनी है तो उसके कॉरस्पॉडिंग हमें क्या करना चाहिए तो आशीष जी सबसे पहले तो आप मुझे यह बताएं कि जैसे मैं कोई भी चीज खरीदने जा रहा हूं रियल एस्टेट से रिलेटेड तो वह काफी इन्फ्लेट है तो उसका क्या रीजन है और यह जो जंप देखने को मिला है एकदम तो इसके पीछे क्या रीजंस है क्यों जंप हुआ है ये देखो रीजन सबसे पहले समझना होगा हो तभी हम समझ पाएंगे कि यह जो आपको अप मूव देखने को मिला है रियल एस्टेट में पहले प्लॉट्स में था फिर उसके बाद फ्लैट में आया है तो ये कब तक रहेगा और कहां पर आपको करेक्शन देखने को मिल सकती है किस साल में देखो मैं अगर बात करूं 2012 में ऐसा बूम देखने को मिला था उसके बाद एक लंबी मंदी के बाद रियल एस्टेट में अब फिर से डिमांड आनी शुरू हुई है और वो हुई है कोरोना काल के बाद उसके पीछे दो ही रीजन थे कि लोग वर्क फॉर्म के चक्कर में वापस अपने घर चले गए थे सप्लाई बिल्कुल नहीं आई थी तो वापस ऑफिस का ओपन अप श होना शुरू हुआ है चाहे आप पुणे की बात करें चाहे आप मुंबई की बात करें बेंगलोर की बात करें या दिल्ली एनसीआर की बात करें लोगों ने वापिस से जवाइन किया है ऑफिस तो पहले रेंटल की डिमांड बड़ी थी रेंटल आसमान छू रहे हैं विने जी रेंटल के बाद लोगों ने कहा कि हमें अपना घर खरीदना चाहिए तो वहां से प्रॉपर्टी की डिमांड शुरू हुई पहले आपके प्लॉट बढ़े उसके बाद फ्लैट में डिमांड आई तो एक रीजन था लोगों का वापस मेट्रो सिटीज में वापस आना पर छोटे सीरीज में भी छोटे शहरों में भी डिमांड आई है एग्रीकल्चर लैंड में भी डिमांड आई है उसका क्या रीजन था उसका रीजन था 2000 की नोटबंदी तो हुआ क्या एक दम से आपकी लिक्विडिटी मार्केट में सामने आई है बिल्कुल लोगों ने पैसा खर्च किया है 2000 नोटबंदी के बाद तो जो पैसा बाहर निकला है बैंकिंग सिस्टम में तो फाइनली गया है जो कि हम डाटा में भी देख पा रहे हैं मुझे ऐसा लगता है पर वो मल्टीपल हाथों से गया है बैंकिंग सिस्टम में तो पहले जब वो पैसा आया तो जमीन लोगों ने खरीदी अगर हम एग्रीकल्चर लैंड की बात करें प्लॉट खरीदे तो वहां से फर्द लिक्विडिटी डिमांड जनरेट हुई आगे उसको इन्वेस्ट करने की तो वो बड़े शहरों से छोटे शहरों की तरफ भी रुख हुआ जमीन की अगर हम बात करें तो वो रीजन था नोटबंदी और लोगों का घर वापस आना तो यह एक और काफी समय से सप्लाई ना आना और एक सेंटीमेंट आपके जो थे इन सब न्यूज के वजह से सुधरे हैं और लोगों को लगने लगा है कि अगर मैंने आज घर नहीं खरीदा आज प्लॉट नहीं खरीदा तो फ्यूचर में तो पता नहीं क्या होगा फ्यूचर में पता नहीं कितना ज्यादा रेट होगा तो इस वजह से आपको रियल सेक्टर में एकदम से बूम आते हुए देखने को मिला है और नए नए डेवलपर्स भी सामने आए जैसे 2012 में भी आए थे विन जी नए नए डेवलपर्स अब आपको सामने आते हुए देखने को मिलेंगे जो कि नए लॉन्च लेक आएंगे बेहिसाब प्राइस प भी होंगे तो आपको अवेयरनेस और रिस्क कॉशस अप्रोच भी अपनानी है वो भी आपके लिए इंपोर्टेंट रहेगा जी तो आशीष जीब मेरे को फॉर एग्जांपल जैसे 2024 आ ही रहा है तो मुझे प्लॉट की तरफ जाना चाहिए या फिर फ्लैट की तरफ जाना चाहिए फ्लैट्स की अवेलेबिलिटी तो काफी होती है बट फ्लैट्स बहुत ज्यादा हैं तो आपकी नजर में फ्लैट वर्सेस प्लॉट अगर हम बात करूं तो आपकी कौन सा ज्यादा मुझे रिटर्न दे सकता है देखो जमीन कम हो रही है विनय जी सब जगह पर चाहे मेट्रो सिटीज की बात कर लो या छोटे शहरों में बात कर लो पहले छोटे शहरों की बात कर लेते हैं जो कि टायर टू टायर सिटी रहती है लुधियाना की बात करें या हरियाणा के कुछ पर्टिकुलर सिटीज की बात करें साउथ में किसी पर्टिकुलर सिटी की बात करें अभी तो सब जगह पर बूम था मुझे लगता है कि वहां पर ये खत्म हो चुका है और ज्यादा मेरे को प्राइज एस्केलेशन की उम्मीद नहीं है क्योंकि छोटे शहरों में ऐसा नहीं है कि विन जी लोगों के पास बाइंग कैपेसिटी बहुत ज्यादा हो आप क्या अनुमान लगाते कि छोटे शहरों में दो करोड़ तीन करोड़ चार करोड़ से ऊपर क्या कोई प्लॉट खरीदेगा या घर खरीदेगा तो मुझे लगता और वहां पर लोन की अगर हम बात करें फाइनली कुछ लोग लोन प भी घर खरीदते हैं तो उनकी सिविल स्कोर को भी अगर आप देखो उनकी टोटल इनकम को भी देखो तो मुझे लगता है कि वो पोटेंशियल उनका खत्म हो चुका होगा तो वहां पर अभी आपको थोड़ा ठंडा माहौल भी देखने को मिल रहा होगा और नए फर्द हाईक प्राइस में नहीं देखने को मिले हो और वहां पर ज्यादातर लोग प्लॉट में इन्वेस्ट करते हैं फ्लैट में नहीं करते हैं तो वहां पर मुझे थोड़ी रिकव देखने को मिलती है तो वहां पर तो मैं कहूंगा कहीं भीभी इन्वेस्ट ना करें एक कहा भी जाता है कि बाय व्हेन पीपल आर इन फियर और सेल व्हेन पीपल आर इन ग्रीड तो जब लालच का माहौल होता है कि मैं छूट जाऊंगा तो उस समय पर तो आपको चीजें बेचनी चाहिए और जब कोई नहीं खरीद रहा होता है तो वही समय होता है पैसा वही लोग बनाते हैं जो कि डर के माहौल में अपना इन्वेस्टमेंट करते हैं जब कोविड के टाइम प कोई नहीं खरीद रहा था जिन जिन्होंने इन्वेस्टमेंट की चाहे इक्विटी में की हो चाहे रियल एस्टेट में की होगी आज वो अच्छा प्रॉफिट कमा के बैठे हैं यहां से कोई खरीदेगा तो पता नहीं कि कितना प्रॉफिट कमाए प्लॉट की अगर हम बात करें विने जी प्लॉट का सिर्फ और सिर्फ एक ही ट्रिगर है एनसीआर रीजन की अगर मैं बात करूं हरियाणा की स्पेसिफिकली बात करूं या गुड़गांव की बात करूं तो अभी प्लॉट के ऊपर फोर्थ फ्लोर को बैन किया गया है ऐसा अनुमान लगाया जा रहा है कि जहां पर भी सड़क की लेंथ 9 मीटर है या पुराने सेक्टर है 12 मीटर है वहां पर शायद आपका फोर्थ फ्लोर ना आए दिन दियाल में तो चांसेस कम लगते हैं पर हां जहां पर प्लॉट का लोकेशन 24 मीटर रोड प है या बड़ी रोड के ऊपर है बड़ा साइज का प्लॉट है 250 स्क्वा यार्ड से ज्यादा है तो प्लॉट आपके लिए हमेशा इन्वेस्टमेंट पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से बेटर रहता है तो प्लॉट आपके कम भी हो रहे हैं या नए लॉन्च नहीं हो रहे हैं तो इन्वेस्टमेंट पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से प्लॉट बेटर है और आपको खुद रहना है रहने के हिसाब से फ्लैट सबसे अच्छा रहता है क्योंकि वहां पर आप जो एमिटी आपको मिलती है तो उसका आप चुनाव करते हैं और माई वन कंस्ट्रक्शन अभी काफी ज्यादा पॉपुलर हो रही है तो नया अगर आपको इन्वेस्टमेंट करना है नए घर में अगर आपको कंस्ट्रक्शन लिंक प्लान के साथ जाना है तो मावन कंस्ट्रक्शन में जाएंगे तो आपके लिए अच्छा रहेगा जी तो आशीष जी अब यहां पर बात कर लेते हैं कि जैसे यह मार्केट बूम कर रही है रियल स्टेट की क्या यह कुछ महीने रह सकती है क्या यहां पर फसने के चांसेस है या क्या यह हाउसिंग बबल की तरह ट्रीट किया जाए कि हाउसिंग मार्केट क्रैश हो सकती है यहां पे तो और कई कई लोग ऐसे सोचते हैं कि मार्केट बूम कर रही है मैं इन्वेस्ट कर दूं बट वही 2015 2016 की हालत ना हो जाए कि मार्केट बिल्कुल एकदम बिल्कुल कोई लेने को तैयार नहीं था तो उस केस में आपकी क्या र रहेगी कि क्या यहां पे हाउसिंग करेक्शन देखने को मिल सकती है बिल्कुल देखने को मिलती है विनय जी ये डर का माहौल अभी नहीं है लोग अभी फियर ऑफ मिसिंग आउट के चक्कर में या शॉर्ट टर्म में प्रॉफिट कमाने के चक्कर में लोग इन्वेस्ट कर रहे हैं और एक दिन में ही अगर आप देखेंगे पूरे के पूरे फ्लैट बिक जाते हैं पर ये एक खतरे की घंटी भी है दो जो 2012 में ऐसा बूम देखने को मिला था वैसा मुझे लगता है कि अगले छ महीने 9 महीने रह सकता है बट उसके बाद हो क्या रहा है विन जी ये समझना है काफी लोग फ्लैट लॉन्च कर रहे हैं अभी आप 10 पर दो बाकी आप पोजीशन पे देना अभी आप 30 पर दो बाकी आप सुपर स्ट्रक्चर के टाइम पे देना तो लोगों को यह मतलब नहीं है कि हम बाद में पैसा कब लेके आएंगे लोग क्या कर रहे हैं अभी 30 पर अपना पैसा दे रहे हैं और सोच रहे हैं कि बाद में जब प्रीमियम आएगा उसको बेच के निकल जाएंगे हो सकता है कुछ लोग ऐसा पैसा बना भी ले बट फाइनली जब एंड यूजर की मार्केट आएगी जब ये फियर ऑफ मिसिंग आउट का माहौल खत्म होगा या जब इनकी नेक्स्ट इंस्टॉलमेंट आएगी सुपरस्ट्रक्चर जो कि मुझे लगता है कि दो साल अभी दूर है दो साल के बाद जब वो सिचुएशन आएगी जब दोबारा बिल्डर पैसा मांगेगा उस समय लोग सप्लाई लेके आएंगे कि मेरा मुझे प्रीमियम आपको एग्जांपल देता रीजन गुरुगांव का एक प्रोजेक्ट था डीएलएफ का ही डीफ अल्मा वहां पर लंचिंग काफी अच्छे प्राइस प हुई थी 9500 के आसपास के हुई थी लोगों ने भर भर के पैसा लगाया था और बाद में वो डिस्काउंट पर भी की थी क्योंकि जब इशू आने शुरू हुए इंस्टॉलमेंट आनी शुरू हुई तो लोगों के पास पैसा नहीं आपको क्या लगता है विने जी 4 करोड़ 5 करोड़ के जिस तरीके से फ्लैट बिक रहे हैं आपको क्या लगता है कि लोगों के पास इतनी लोन की कैपेसिटी है या उनके पास वाइट मनी इतनी है जो वो दे पाएंगे हो सकता है कि एनआरआई जो बाय कर रहे हैं वो उतना सप्लाई कर पाए पर फाइनली एंड यूजर की इसको मार्केट को बनना है इन्वेस्टर्स को बाहर आना है और जब ये नेक्स्ट इंस्टॉलमेंट आएगी सुपरस्ट्रक्चर की कंप्लीट होने की या नेक्स्ट आपके पास जब जेब से 60 पर पैसा जाएगा तो लोग उसको बेचने निकलेंगे और जब सप्लाई आएगी तो बिल्कुल यहां से करेक्शन देखने को मिलेगी जिस तरीके से प्राइस बढ़ रहे है हां कुछ बेल्ट में हो सकता है आपको फायदा हो अभी नया एयरपोर्ट खुला है ग्रेटर नोडा में तो वहां पर एक प्राइस बूम समझ आता है द्वारका एक्सप्रेसवे बड़ा है वहां पर एक प्राइस एप्रिसिएशन समझ आता है पर 20000 के भाव पर मुझे समझ नहीं आता पर स्क्वायर फीट प हां 10000 का जिस सिचुएशन से मार्केट चल रही है वो एक रीजनेबल प्राइस मुझे दिखता है अयोध्या में प्रॉपर्टी के प्राइस बड़े वो समझ आता है पर कितना बढ़ेगा कितना प्राइस एक एप्रोप्राइटिंग आने वाला है 2024 में नहीं पर 2025 में तो मुझे दिखता है क्रैश रियल एस्टेट सेक्टर में तो कोशिस अप्रोच अपनाए एंड यूजर फाइनली फंस जाते हैं अभी ये इन्वेस्टर मार्केट है यहां पर रोज वो प्राइस बढ़ा रहे हैं सोच रहे हैं कि आज मैं थोड़ा पैसा डालूं और वहां से अपना रेट ऑफ रिटर्न जो है जो आरओ आई की बात करें हम तो वो वो उनको ज्यादा अच्छा दिखता है कम पैसा लगा के बट जब डिमांड आएगी उसके बाद यहां पर बिल्कुल आपको करेक्शन देखने को मिलेगी तो कॉशस अप्रोच लगाए किस पर्पस के लिए आप इन्वेस्ट कर रहे हैं अगर आप एंड यूजर है तो एंड यूजर के हिसाब से अपना घर खरीदें एक घर खरीदें फ्लैट की अगर हम बात करें बाकी इन्वेस्टमेंट के बिने जी बहुत सारे हरिजन है आपके लिए क्यों इतना रिस्क लेना है बड़े अमाउंट का रिस्क लेना है बाकी आप धीरे-धीरे अपना बाकी हरिजन में अपना इन्वेस्टमेंट कर सकते हैं अब जाते जाते बात करते हैं कि अगर मैं हील स्टेशन की बात करूं वहां पर भी काफी ज्यादा इन्वेस्टमेंट्स देखने को मिली है तो आपकी क्या राय रहेगी कि वहां पर इन्वेस्टमेंट करना कितना सही रहेगा देखो वहां पर लोगों का बिल्कुल बकल रुझान बड़ा है और जिस तरीके से ग्लोबल वार्मिंग हो रही है और एनसीआर रीजन की अगर मैं विन जी बात करूं जिस तरीके से पोल्यूशन है तो बिल्कुल हील स्टेशन के पास आप प्रॉपर्टी में इन्वेस्ट कर सकते हैं काफी लोग वहां पर अट्रैक्ट भी हो रहे हैं वहां पर आपको अच्छा

उसी से समझे कि किस जगह पर ऐसा ना हो कि आप बिल्कुल पहाड़ पे लैंड खरीद ले जैसे जोशी मट की बात करें या कुछ जगह पर लैंड स्लाइड भी देखने को मिली है या जमीन खिसक रही है तो ध्यान रखें कि हिल स्टेशन में आप कहां बाय कर रहे हैं देहरादून एक अच्छी अपॉर्चुनिटी है क्योंकि वो थोड़ा सा फ्लैट प आपका आ जाता है बाकी बिल्कुल मेजर हिल स्टेशन प लेने से बचे और आपको ये भी देखना है हिल स्टेशन प अगर आप रहने भी जाते हैं तो वहां पर एमिटी क्या मिल रही है हॉस्पिटल्स भी है कि नहीं है वहां पे अच्छे स्कूल है कि नहीं है क्योंकि देहरादून का मैंने एग्जांपल क्यों दिया वहां पर अच्छे स्कूल्स भी है हॉस्पिटल्स भी है तो वहां पर और दिल्ली देहरादून की काफी अच्छी सिक्स ले हाईवे बनने वाला है तो वो कनेक्टिविटी आपकी अच्छी होने वाली है तो देख और सोच समझ के करें अ लैंड का बिल्कुल देखें कि किस तरह की आप लैंड खरीद रहे हैं रियल एस्टेट प्लॉट तो बिल्कुल विन जी ओवर ए लॉन्ग टर्म आपको अच्छा रिटर्न बिल्कुल देता है तो इन्वेस्टमेंट के लिए प्लॉट में ही इन्वेस्ट करें वो ज्यादा अच्छा रहता है"

      "Good insightful podcast but I wish Raj would have let the guest speak more and interrupt less. Let the guest speak more.",
      "Brother i am observing in  your so many podcast, to turn or change the topic you broke the link of the guest when they are giving there opinion. You should have to wait for complete there POV and then carry on because some time i feel like i want to know more about that specific topic but you divert it suddenly. Think on it its just a little suggestion, otherwise your podcasts are great i loved it and i am enjoying it.....",
      "I am actually new to all this but fortunately for I was introduced to Mr Ronal’ and I want to say a big thank you for sharing your knowledge with me and I’m also earning more than I expect. God bless you sir",
      "Wow Raj I really Loved the whole conversation between you and Ajitesh,( it was so realistic).\nGreat!",
      "Loved the podcast with Mohit Yadav. Loved the humility the guy has.",
      "One of the best power packed pragmatic guest! Learned so much from this one.",
      "Raj, another gem of a conversation. Please bring on more guest of real estate sector, this being a very big field diversity wise alongside being a highly capital intensive sector, more of auch guests would be heartly appreciated.",
      "You need to own at least one piece of real estate. Period. It puts you in a different league of peace of mind.",
      "Refreshing man. This was good. Learnt a lot. Thanks.",
      "His calculations in RentvsBuy is wrong.\nYou cant earn 20L with the investment of 20L in four years.\nHe said house is of 1Cr, equity is 20L and 80L is loan, after 4 year home price will be 1.3Cr minus 80 loan minus 20 equity and minus 10L loan repayment is 20L profit. \n\nBut 10L loan repayment in four years means 2.5L in one year and approx 20K per month..\nYour loan EMI is never 20K for the loan amount of 80L.\n\nEMI of 80L loan for 20years will be approx 65k per month. Per year its 7.8L and for four year its 32L..\nSo if house price go up from 1Cr to 1.3Cr then you are at loss of 2L.. This only if price go to 1.3Cr.. Most cases it wont.",
      "Thanks Raj. He was the most knowledgeable guests you ever had on ur show.",
      "Why do we even debate on \n\"Rent vs buy\" for real state and house\n\nMy class mate's father died few years ago but his father made a big house\nThey gave that house on rent and \nThey get good money per month\n\n\n\nIf you can buy house then you must",
      "Wat a podcast! OMG, brilliant. Thank you guys.",
      "1cr flat with 80 lac loan- intrest rate 9.4%, 20 years, emi 71k then for four years only intrest amount will be 30 lac. If you sold @1.3cr after 4 years means no profit at all. But you loose intrest for your own 20lacs",
      "Very intresting & knowledge based - Great job.\nA suggestion - Give the guest more time to speak keeping ur question Crisp",

      "string": "[Music] do you feel Market you need to analyze where the supply demand variance and how the country is going to behave there's no Golden Rule major selling point yes important Point without even in the best of the market and in the lowest of the price you still can't s I've seen you know developers or again agents selling things on the paper not few hundreds hundreds of crores but thousands of crores to thousands of investors and essentially those projects will never take off government tenders have cleanly National is more cleaner than State politics plays very important role in real estate in a short term yes longterm no how can someone from a middle class get rich with real estate episode demanded topic that is real estate disc buying in few cities and buying prefer in few cities over rent episode with the founder of asbl aesu before you do that go subscribe rajani Clips or Rani short channel enjo the nice and this you started your parents started what's the scene so basically my I come from Real Estate family background so my father started Ashoka Builders and then we realized that you know right and then we us to have lot of fights right dinner table Jag which my mom used to be the judge of the settlement party so after that uh you know then we sat down one sham and then both of us mutually agreed that it's it's in the best interest that we take a different course of action the different course of action so I then he told okay you go start your own company right uh uh wherever I can share my wisdom with you but it's all yours now you have to start from scratch so then we started in 2017 asbl as full uh Ashoka Builders India private limited I want to ask you a question which is very important especially rent versus [Laughter] [Music] buy see definitely when when somebody is in their 20s they should not buy a house renting is better because there is people need to invest and save and see one thing you look at the other in 20s your earning is also not much so housing is a costly product fin Comfort right as you go into 30s mental sense of [Music] comfort it's a it's a costly Affair cheap AFF cost right unless you know I would suggest people once when you have sufficient money right you buy a house because see any which way every person in the life will Any Which Way buy a house one house at least because it's just the sense of comfort house uh gives you a great sense of comfort but right you know right time like 20s is not probably not the right time 30s do you think especially bbay Bangalore Delhi specifically let's talk about Bombay residential rental 2% correct [Laughter] Lally right let's say I'm running I'm doing a job and I'm I'm making money right uh ultimately my savings have to go and create assets yeah right it might be liquid assets like it can be physical asset like gold or real estate or anything so people transfer their savings into assets that's Point number one next point is so see aage right 5 to 6% inflation right so and then 15% 20% essentially right so when you layer all these things you get a good return very good return it will almost run to 15 to 16% if you want I'll explain in a very simple right had 20 lakhs 80 lakhs bank right and it takes to build the house right and then every year let's assume the house is appreciating at at an inflation adjusted rate of 5 to 6% four years compounding 30% simple 30% right 1.6 into 1.6 into 1.06 into 06 into 06 right so 80 plus 10 lakh 1.3 20 methology so if you are looking at housing asset as an investment this is housing asset as an investment then your strategy should be always buy at the beginning and exit upon getting OC and do this only with developers who have a track record of giving projects on time so yes stocket you invest with companies which have good capabilities top five top index in a 10 year Horizon than real estate see if you look on a 10year horizon right uh there have been I one of my wealth management uh you know friend has sent me a portfolio like he he he analyzed 10 years and he was piing he he broke broke it down into two twoyear windows and he divided that into some 20 assets stock market metal trading agre product trading Tech estc real estate gold Guild everything so at at every different time each asset class performed differently so there is no standardized rule here at all right the thing with Equity see if you look at the index right index performs youl you know good times you make that extra Alpha you make 15 16% also you make it so it purely depends on your particular strategy and you need to analyze at what which point of time where the supply demand variance and how the country is going to behave so there is no straight cut rule if one goes with the straight cut rule they might make the 10 12% but somebody who who customized to themselves or did better research might make more somebody who just blindly put it might lose okay so there is no one you know one single rule there's no Golden Rule okay EST opportun for a young entrepreneur who wants to start a career uh for anyone I'll give by the way 35 and above because then you start making more money and there a sense of stability there's a sense of stability right recently globally including India okay so they did this survey in top 15 countries India included top 15 countries people in their 20s are making more money than people in their 30s true in Last 5 Years True Okay so the whole debate was around this okay there's so much consumption happening and so much spending power has like gone up because people in 20s are making more money mhm so if people are in their 20s are making more money than people who are in their 30s probably they should start logic like they should probably from this logic they should start investing in the house today because the argument on this was a lot of people did this argument that you want to wait and see whether this trend continues no mhm someone who's making too much money in their 20s today will they be able to make same kind of money in their 30s as well and will it appreciate the way it appreciated in the previous decade as well MH but the argument was that because they are doing it in fast Dynamic Quick Change environment so quickly people are making money and then quickly they're going to stop making money as well mhm so people who are making a lot of money in their 20s should be very cautious because in 30s they won't be able to make money because they're careers which didn't existed correct like didn't exist 10 years ago so now there are like new careers for you and that's why you're making demand Supply Gap and then 10 years your carers either will get democratized or won't exist so you need to be very very careful about what you're doing so this was the whole argument and I loved this whole article if you want I can send it to you I loved it correct I I have I have my viewpoint on this I've not read the report but I presume it's right but I think it's it's from a very narrow context right uh definitely I think it's only from the taxation point of view people who are paying tax tax payers in 20s and tax payers in 30 so essentially then they're only taking in people who are working in the knowledge economy right knowledge economy is a very small component of the overall pip coming back to actually this question do you think opportun one opportun maybe second generation entrepreneur in fact the better in our father's generation I've seen this you know like in a small village or a small town or small City where they will accumulate this money the five set 25 and aspiration was different 5 set 25 they would get like a small flat or small something right they would easily get it I'm talking about 20 probably so same estely based on making more money and asset based if break down real estate essentially I would like to break it down into three categories real estate categories three categories from a commercial or enterprising or entrepreneu opportunity perspective right opportunity perspective right one is your traditional real estate appr building right I would say 70% of our business is in that right and other thing next thing is you can you know the entire aspect of see real estate is a very big supply chain right you you can you can cat hold of particular Point Solutions right like for example you want to specialize in uh in sales aspect right how do maybe now there are globally companies which have earned like you know millions of dollars some have even touched billions of dollars so you specialize in one particular aspect M you okay I will not worry about getting land and all this thing I'll only worry about engineering right M I'll get into Contracting space okay engineering is labor issue I don't want to deal with it I'll only get into sales aspect right you can get into getting into Channel partner sales partnership thing or you can get into digital this is one aspect right where one particular component of the supply chain you catch and you excel in that that's one thing there are better opportunities here than the prior one the third one I call is prop Tech right most people don't put it under real estate category but I would like to consider it under the real estate category you can use technology to build great productivity in real estate and then you know you know you can scale much faster so the these are the three aspects the entrepreneur skill the bigger opportunity lies in the third one prop Tech field next is this the traditional there I would say amongst these there's lesser opportunity because it's fairly you don't have a new idea existing ideas already people know it they know better than you so you won't have much space so yeah it depends on which you know what it is if you want to enter the traditional space I don't think there's much opportunity m in fact if you actually see I I met with few in my known Circle my friends uh friends they were they were senior guys in IBM research scientist type and when I asking what is the next big thing like you know because you're working in IBM headquarter so you're the probably the corest of the group there so they were telling see there's only 10% of data available on the internet 90% of the data is not available is what they told I think that even needs to be corrected that 90% May another 90% is not even collected anywhere it's not just Bond so whoever collects those is the next big thing right so a lot of data is just not captured capturing so establishing that is where I feel our Prime business is moving so our traditional business is real estate but our our growth driver is our tech company which is built around you know the application is is a field engineering application okay so it creates a virtual twin and uh you collect a lot of data around it so this data is nowhere collected so using this data we can like you know you like let's say you want to build a 40f Flor apartment a project you don't need to do any you don't need to know anything you just have to subscribe to our neural schema all right so basis on that schema your 40f FL project will be built you don't need to know anything so that's where the future is heading future is heading towards a lot of such models prefixed models and that models need to be validated with lot of data to identify that that's a right model and the company which has such a technology will have a good stint at the future so you feel the new the next billion dollar opportunity for Indians at this point m is to start thinking about no matter which industry you are in mhm just care about how can you collect more data in your industry because that data will give you enough insights to build a large business and large outcome out of it absolutely yes absolutely and still there is 9x opportunity there what has so far happened with Amazon Google Chat gpts and all is only 10% but give me an example of how data can help us out let's say for example I want to make it very clear okay how technology is has a vital role you know in in disrup real estate right but there's a lot of lot of I'm just I'm I'm talking like a 45y old Uncle building is a that way so that it gives more perspective right yes yeah so I so if you look at uh uh what happens day to-day on sites like let's say one of our project it's a live project we are we are building 400 apartments in a project where I'm building 400 apartments in threee Span I'm consuming 8 and a half million to 9 million man hours H right so that's a very huge number of mans with different people different skill sets heterogeneous skill set okay all these 9 million are different uh people with different skill sets at different points of time right now you see the optimization which can be done at such a scale so day-to-day what happens on sites is that laborers come right gang of laborers they might be anywhere from a batch of 10 people to 50 people right and then the project manager or you know allots them work okay your flat number 5506 66 things like that right this process is highly inefficient one when the process when the project manager is telling them which flat or which location in that per se to go he doesn't have the list of all the locations there may be 30 locations but human mind cannot remember the 30 locations second thing these laborers have come at 8:00 project manager time you know he he he didn't come to the site yet they will wait or he just went for his rounds into the project they'll wait so as a 2 three hours in a day just waiting right and then they allocated work and after then again they come back just hours hours hours hours time goes right which is where we created a virtual twin system where this job essentially telling the laborers where to go they know what work to do if I'm a plumbing laborer I not do concreting work right where to go is a very very essential thing which in our company our AI does it's not done by human because of it there's a 34% increase in productivity because why not of because they have they had boost or anything simply because they're not waiting they come to the site they take their equipment directly go to that location 34% our contractor's bottom lines are almost going up by you know 20 22% so what will happen naturally he will pay more for his laborers because he need laborers more because he's earning good profit here so that's what I mean by increase in productivity so using this I'm able to finish my building instead of 8 and half million man hours in 7 and half million man hours so the 10 million Man 1 million manover is a huge value gain that's one aspect where technology is playing a definite role see it's like imagine to put in perspective you know beehive right beehive there is one queen bee and there are millions of soldier bees so think about these as laborers right these Soldier bees goes and does only one task collect pollen store here that's it they're doing homogeneous T what happens in a site is similar but heterogeneous so certain bees certain laborers go and do concrete works certain uh laborers go and do plumbing works like that there are almost all we broke it down to 800 different Works 800 different 800 different works at almost all 3,000 different locations at different points of time now imagine the optimization what can run and imagine doing this at a country scale see we are India's second biggest employer the sector is India's second biggest employer real estate real estate it's India second big first is it no no first first is agre agre agre it less number but right so so if productivity goes up here two things happen one those who are there their wages will go up next you'll free up a lot more laborers who can move into other sectors see there are a lot of sectors where there's deficit of laborers right where these people can be upskilled and go there and they learn much better that's how China grew or any America or Europe in the in the prime years so productivity gains has to happen right this technology will come in huge handy there imagine at a at a country scale see I'm making 400 apartment mototi India will be making around 4 lakh Apartments 400 apartments I'm using mototi around 10 million mans multiply that by what thousand times so you're talking about 10 billion manuvers optimization there that's going to make us rocket speed that will you know take the country's GDP to much higher figures also the penetration of technology in this field is very low and uh India government of India 11 National are run through our digital twin technology and Amad we are doing a Amad Urban Development Authority projects so it's a smart city project so that we are doing and Chennai may also we are bidding so yeah I think we want to it's like this we want the every column to have a voice and speak every road every we now our digital twin is there even in the road sector every 10 met of road to tell about its birth history like that government projects you talked about that these you're taking highways and stuff like that so luckily for us we don't directly deal with the government and with central government I feel it's fairly structured and streamlined and digitized also they've made a portal like Amazon where people can bid and get so we I think with most in that aspect most of the country has become fairly clean really right yeah 20 years back 10 years back things were different government of cleanly significantly I wouldn't say National or State national is more cleaner than state but everything is in a percentage let's say National is 80 percentage state is 60 65 percentage eventually incrementally every year the 5% is becoming cleaner 60% kit tenders are like that's it majority of it is clean should be clean is what I'm thinking come on don't go back don't go back like I I think you need to understand this better yeah I state to state it will vary maybe in certain States it might only be 20% yeah that's what was because my next question was going to be I read a book yesterday I mean some part of book I read yesterday uh it's an advanced copy of a book called Bihar okay biar the politics the business of the entire State and what's going on like so I just read couple of pages in Advan copy I just received it yesterday by an author who's going to publish it soon right certain States I was going to ask you I was like okay hey let's talk see certain States like BR and maybe Bengal like up was there before but now it's totally changed significantly changed I would say but yeah certain I would say economically backward States the transparency is very less so contract or or like just say a normal credible guy also got he might not get payment two things can happen influence your cleaniness of books or your track record what happens yes that happens so that C clearly yes yes that happens what the worst thing You' have seen see at least in the city from which I come from uh and again I'm a fairly new Builder and I've only been in this for last five six years right uh I've seen uh you know developers or again agents selling things on the paper to the tune of not few hundreds hundreds of crores but thousands of crores to thousands of investors and essentially those projects will never take off the investors maybe 5% of them know until now the rest 95% still is okay they don't know the day they know it will become like a massive chit Fund scam or a bank scam Bank Run sort of thing that I think is a little uh you know again this is not again I would say not everybody's exposed there but a lot of people are but 20% of the market exposed to such things is also a big thing so I've seen things being totally you know the way money is taken from The Last Mile the customer uh there I think a lot more transparency can come in and the customer also see they get carried away because of the peer pressure the foro or sometimes just greed right and then without doing their due diligence and it has in fact in our city there's one group I won't take the name but it recently come out in the media 1,800 CR scam SC yeah they just sold project on the paper not more than uh there's nothing which not even a stone moved on the site or probably very little thing has happened on the site so and then 1,800 CR of money was taken from people and then some people took away their FD money or probably some people and all you know took away the savings or something like that and then they ran into some medical crisis and then it was it all came out in the media it was a very big thing but yeah those have to stop those have to stop so that I think is the most I would say recently that I'll tell you specifically around the country happening yes right yes so and either own either they ran away they led the country they're out of fit whatever they're doing or they're so powerful that nobody's able to touch them or they've done it in such a clean way that the company who sold all of this true inoc and I was reading about it definitely this is more in tier 2 cities one cities it has come down drastically years last say come come see as again as the you know developers segment becomes more organized then you have a reputation to lose and all of that it's it it happens a lot less so most of these are done by Fly by Night operators or sometimes even established guys but less chances there probabilistically speaking CER two cities May it's much higher and you go more into District headquarters this is a rampant business model so you'll be lucky if your plot has only one owner you'll be lucky really in smaller District this happens a lot yes it happens because there what happens Naraj because the the local politics Law and Order in a way Judiciary everything is controlled by these people so where will you go and complain what so that's where I feel reforms more reforms as the political reforms and Judiciary reforms if from a real estate perspective I think political reforms I feel I'm happy with it that progressively you're getting better and there is no overnight medicine in this I mean it's practical right but judicial reforms I think is something which is holding back these sectors and failing the last M the person there ready you now that happened right you go and put the case 30 years you'll have to go to the court uh you know the corridors and one you might not have the money second thing after 30 years you only won't be there now so so I think Judiciary has to really up there game you very important question real estate local city cities don't know six seven cars with proper Z Plus sort of security don't know something right I because I was like Wow and then my friend said I was like okay similarly I've seen it in indor most of the big uh big real estate developers I've seen I've seen the same thing in Mumbai I've seen the same thing in Delhi right why is there a case real estate developers like perpetually informally very curious question I was never able to ask this to one of my friends in real estate maybe internal reason I can ask you this and I'm Bangalore hyad but I'll explain the reason why it happens see most of the cases the the people who came into real estate essentially were people who are very close to politics or some sort of muscle Advantage M you had Gund like you had people whom you could tell and they can get it sorted those sort of fields this is one aspect so in in like let's say you you stole land away from somebody right naturally there'll be an angst you never know how they'll reciprocate it that could be one reason second reason is your deliveries with your customers this I'm seeing more this I'm this trend is picking up your deliveries with your customer fail then somewhere or the other they are going to react right when the reaction comes out like this then you need these people to block them that's the why do you need security because if somebody is attacking you you need security politics plays very important role in real estate absolutely I would say if you're close to a politician in your city then you have higher chances of winning in Pol in real estate in a shortterm yes longterm no longterm is exactly the opposite because the opponent when he comes over he'll screw you Oh Real Estate that's why if you look at a lot of well EST you ask even the wisest thing in real estate is don't be aligned with politics at all right because it does so when when you know somebody in you know higher rank in the politics things happen very easily for you and then when the opponent comes then all the easiness will become tough then okay some you know why but then because higher 0% the other guy will feel like you know when you're making this money also right the particular politician is also invested with you right it's not that you have given money and he left so that tangle so you want to go after political V so only if they attack you will that also come out and it happens so the wisest thing is not to be but then do think but then a politician would come okay top floor at this price example I heard this story recently so he can screw you over yes so all of these things happen they do but I'll share the light in this politicians there is some level of fear all across so nobody wants to be caught very blatantly uh committing the mistake right if at all there is see how the politic politician or any I would say the powerful person there how they do is if there is some violation there right then they have an Arbitrage let's say you're 95% as per why I say 95 not 100 because rules suddenly change overnight in this if you're 95% as per rule they also cannot do that or at least in the state or city from where I come from that's the case and one question I always [Music] had MH but on books so black and white according to guidelines proper correct example right books through correct why is it not coming down so is two things first first of all tell you I'll tell you why why one should not buy don't I don't go and buy steel you know inv and again with comes with experience and when you know when when some of the investors were telling me of the stories which they got duped and when I could map them all I realized this in all this projects 30% investment amount 30% most of the chances the project turned turned bad so first low cash right absolutely don't give cash there will be alternates go by alternate there's but there are a lot of people G authenticity local let's say take all that risk rather so I would say strong because you can only claim the account which has come to my bank account really yes and project went bust you want to claim you'll only get 50 lakhs make peace with it% and even if I even if the developer writes a chitty and the customer writes a chitty and you publish in the Cod the guy who has given the cash he'll also go to the jail what happened what do you think what happened in NOA see one thing one major thing called profile financing let's say you are an individual who's earning like 50 lakh per year annual package monthly right and you're eligible for if if you go buy a home you are eligible for let say home loan bu agents loan eligibility right so you come and take the loan the loan is taken on your name right and one Builder Bank 12% 11 to 12% because I'm financing it through home loan I've reduced my cost by almost 30% for 50% almost all right and then I've and to my banker also I'll show it it's a revenue booking I got my Revenue Char flatb B so this artificially inflated the revenue book of a company so in reality what are the sales zero but on book it's four so Banker will put some guidelines okay boss you do 10 sales or 20% I'll give you the next uh 20% of the amount so I'm booking all this to my profile financing and the guy who invested 50 lakhs because I'm also benefiting I'll give you some 25 lakhs or 30 lakhs or maybe another 50 lakhs so essentially that's the check and when when the market became really tough and they're unable to do the regular sales what they started doing they stopped construction and who is the guy who is caught in this you or whoever the guy who who was the profile financer this was very huge because of which because of the availability of profile financing Supply went over the roof and I fin creative financing so there naturally the product Market fit would have been wrong that market is just not ready or just as gross over Supply no product Market fit can do research so naturally strugg yeah very interesting Financial engineering 90% of real estate companies are Financial engineering they're in and trust me they're very Innovative in this just that not all Innovations lead to good outcomes yeah right there an innovation which leads to dangerous outcome this is I do know this this is very new information for me I love it I love knowing about new things this is I don't know why I've never heard about this profile financing and this is the reason why Noida went bust went bust this was one single reason one of the major reasons so why did Noida went bust simple answer profile financing profile financing Yes W the balance sheet is inflated there's no real customer there you know this is happening in Navi Mumbai as well early signs people are looking at this in N Mumbai now profile financing a lot of people bought Navi Mumbai plots and Nai Mumbai K State in a hope that there's a new adani airport which is coming in no which is one of the biggest right but all the major Airlines have declined to operate from there did you know this I that I didn't know why like recently I read the news like 2 3 days ago so Airlines like Indigo which is a major operator which is a major operator they've said no that they're not going to operate from there because of the distance they like they don't have enough demand from Navi Mumbai and Mumbai customers they don't want to send it to Novi Mumbai because it's a major blocker and they lose a major market share so they're not ready to operate from there and if you're not ready to operate from there then they're not money fly exactly so flight airport almost whole airport is going to go bust because if you look at the airport business airport business is not airport business it's a mall business correct you're right it's actually a good way of look the whole airport is a fancy Mall mhm which takes you to your flight muh the whole way is converted into a mall and the bigger the airport the better the revenue because the whole area they have designed it into a mall everybody talks about because the major Revenue comes from these shops interesting so the airport is like a mall and they just want to keep making better better better malls and that comes if you attract the right kind of Airlines okay then there will large majority of money they're going to make through through this this is very very important information I hope people know it through this I didn't know like of course I mean I do though I don't operate here I do follow the news span India I didn't know about this I thought it was a natural thing that it moves to Navi Mumbai city is even I thought even I thought the same thing but I read it like 2 three days ago where they're like adani airports are now trying to convince these Airlines I'm sure they will figure out some way some some way okay I have last uh four or five questions and these are quick more more let's say most Googled question s okay so I want to ask you this major selling point yes important Point without was even in the best of the market and in the lowest of the price you still can't sell so it's that strong uh and in fact when it comes to vastu 80% of it is genuine science it's good for the user of the product Lighting in the kitchen they say is because in the olden days the homaker used to cook right that's her Factory space that's her office space right and sunlight is very important for humans right now we are taking Replacements vitamin D right so 80% is genuine logic 20% in get Superstition so yeah but yeah it's very important very important okay and how can someone from a middle class get rich with real estate hm see fell just like what I mentioned earlier right uh use see real estate may you have to use debt if you don't use debt real estate is not your asset class boss you shouldn't be here right so let's say you're earning 3 lakh salary loan eligibility right you go buy a house right in the beginning with a good Builder again who has a track record and right upon Handover exit you will make your 30 40% return on your uh principal or I mean say 20 22% 20 % you will make on a fouryear component is a lot of money even stock markets don't do that but uh this you need to do it with a good Builder and a good location and right go right when the product project starts and exit right after like once they get an OC plus minus got it okay then very important question I want to know your take on this why are property prices in India skyrocketing in last few years uh okay see majorly I will say uh because there was pandemic everybody were stuffed into the house right and suddenly that's the product which people are using in a day-to-day life what happens you get up use the house for very few active hours if you see you only use for 3 hours and then you're out you're no more no longer using the product in terms when the pandemic was there this product was being used almost 4X more 12 to 15 hours you are active 12 to 15 in a day where you are in the house only so whichever product you use more then you want more of it if you know you you want bigger so that translated into need of bigger space and when you were in your house what were you doing you were working now house generally is not a workspace now you're working so M what you need more space because the house has to give you more functionality right have to go you have to buy a bigger engine or a four cross same thing so now you're doing work out of house so you need more space to compensate for that feature right hence that extra 3400 squ ft right and next at time of pandemic that 1 to two years people were traveling less so more discretionary income on their hand and next thing uh even the interest rates were low back in the day that led to a huge you know sudden uh you know explosion of demand and then it's going then now you see interest rates have gone have definitely increased right so it is build it is bringing again some level of stability but yeah that was the latency and post pandemic the reverse has not occurred it's not that now people pandemic all five days I'll go to office that's not happening right hybrid work is here to stay yeah right and especially most consumers of housing are working in the knowledge economy or the service sector economy so where hybrid econom hybrid work culture is a pretty normal thing so hence the demand is continuing but do you think it has anything to do with NRI buying more houses in India that is also there two reasons yeah that's a good thing what you cited so with n what's happening is one again dollar has appreciated a lot against the rupee so how for us 15 % the prices have gone for for them the 15% has not happened because currency Advantage so it cost lesser for them Point number one point number two there's a reverse brain Rin which is happening a lot of nras especially Millennials do not see themselves to be staying in uh in you know in in US particularly or Europe wherever they're staying for long term they see that there's a lot of opportunity back home in India I'm here working for five six years to make a decent savings and I'm going back opportunity whereas at the same time those economies are S I wouldn't say sinking but they're definitely stabilizing or slightly going towards a lesser growth so they don't see much opportunities so the NRA buying has gone up a lot yes okay then another question ke I want you to be very honest here what are the hidden charges behind buying a house which a normal customer doesn't get to know okay uh I think this this generally even I also when look up online this quite a trending thing surprising thing is in hyad it's very less it's quite you know it's all laid out I think it's particularly NCR and Bombay W question this is okay because I yeah it looks like they didn't charge us more see first one needs to know the basic cost like per SF BOS and then maybe they charger for parkings so parking you need to know are they charging or no next thing is club house and amenities are they charging or no next is then there's a special thing like okay east facing more prefer so east facing extra here it might be some Park View SE view or any view right and on top of this uh check for maintenance maintenance anyways the developer doesn't take but it's something which you have to shut down check for maintenance and Corpus and any other legal expenditure on top of this check for uh when like you know the Clause where let's say invoice is raised and what is the duration what is the penalty let's say developer raises the invoice boss 10 lak 10 lak money pay and then for how long the interest is not levied on that it might be 15 to 30 days invoice credit period after that how much money is he charging as interest check for these things rest to there's only GST and stamp Duty which you will know which which is fairly transparent okay um what do people look in a property before buying what do common people should look in a property uh from a builder perspective tell me see I I'll tell you this bu uh see okay I'll tell you this place see many people miss out two things one they do not really understand how much is it that they can afford and that is where a builder can get the better side of them one needs to and they end up let's say I can afford a 100 rupe product I end up buying a 130 rupe product and that's dangerous for the immediate 3 4 years of my financial life I have to really suffer with that because my discretionary income will be hugely cut off right so that's some area where they can become beu right be very very uh I would say determined when it very very informed when it comes to what is the extent to which you can buy next thing is uh be very very very important you know very uh I would say I have lot of knowledge on what is the flow plan because see the club house and all this now these are like the item numbers in the movie right uh but the story if a movie has to hit you see no movie will get hit because of the item number have you seen any movie none movie gets hit only because of the story so the story in the project whatever one might say oh you got a rooftop pool or pool started with gold I don't know whatever on Earth or facing in case of Bombay overlooking the Arabian or whatever but fall in love with the flow plan only if you because ultimately that's the story you're going to live in the flow plan not on the pool so be very understanding of what is your requirements and will this flow plan solve it now last two questions one is how is Western real estate market is different from India mhm is it see one is from the regulatory perspective both are almost the same this there's lot of I would say localized rules in the west and in India from what the customers point of view do you think people buy more there or buy more here this it really depends uh Raj uh because uh wherever whenever people see opportunity and in the market they participate and real estate is the B it's it's the bucket which has most of your savings especially from middle class to upper class that's where a lot of the savings will go into so that's world over is the same thing right so whenever people see opportunity they move into it in the west what has been happening is there are more conglomerates which have been pushing out the end user right something like your there was few companies that house flipping company and they go and buy off the house and lot of banks like you know Black Rock black stone these sort of guys bought lot of houses so you can't compete with them that happen that happens in so hence I don't know what what exactly how much amount of meat is left for the inducer in India that is not the case good amount of meat is there for the enduser but they need to you know spot it wisely so you can go buy a house for an investment purpose and then flip it and still make a decent return if the opportunity is left in India yeah the opportunity is more in India less invest in that line and second as a buying Behavior India May lot of people buy under construction properties and the banks fund it us that doesn't happen Banks do not fund under construction property they have to buy a ready to move in property so a lot of ready to RTM ready to move in properties are sold more in the US than in India and generically the demand there is less because population is declining and theyve already they have built out houses for most people in but they already have a lot of people who have bought houses yeah that's also there the demographic is also there okay last question a lot of people are exploring a new kind of investment opportunity in real estate mhm which is very big phenomena in US mhm that is Airbnb mhm or Holiday Homes right so in Goa also this has started growing a lot laava started K started happening absolutely what people do is they buy houses and they give it to some management Agency for them to run it on Airbnb or something and then they run it and annually 15 20% they give it back to you correct right do you think it's a good opportunity in India or no it is it is I should more people think about these creative models of Tourism or Holiday Homes like and give it to airbnbs or St Vista or I don't know 20 other companies as well saffron homes yeah it is again is one has to again once they dellve into it they'll realize that okay you can't see essentially what what's happening you are targeting the hotela customer right Hotel May the highend paying customer right so if you if you really make it in a Exquisite manner like a boutique manner you will do exceptionally well there's good opportunity at least for the next 5 to 10 years because India has now begun really traveling so we are traveling a lot within our country so and afford you know affordability is also going people want that Exquisite that good you know that Exquisite experience Boutique experience if your property can give that I mean returns are very good and in fact another Trend which will also come up in line with this is a fractional ownership already it has begun the lot of companies in the space which is doing that that also is going to pick up and with dig ization of land records so land is your land or builtup space is your asset right once the entire ownership of that gets digitized in fact for owning of space it's already digitized your s deed C digitization at least in our state it's there I don't know in various other states but if that once that happens right so the fractional ownership will go for a boom go for a boom tell me top five cities for tourism or holiday home sort of investment opportunities which you see right now in India one to everybody I think it's Goa right I think Northeast has some hidden gems there because of this see when people are going to these sort of things it's very destination based yeah so you know a lot so it has to really you know survive that parameter I think the Northeast and uh has some wonderful opportunities then Goa is there and then the North Region the Himalayas region so either it's Hills or the sea okay that's it yes because these have to be Boutique experience you can't have like this jungle experiences jungle is also a boutique in way but it can't be like okay City TOA experience like you come and build in middle of Bombay I don't think it works bandra view B yeah I don't yeah slum tourism is is growing in India like is yeah I was reading yeah there's a tour on on Airbnb dhavi slum tour oh and which is provided by multiple host now huh and it's every time I see it at least three four of them are almost full every every weekend oh wow I mean that's that's very good actually if people want to see what's happening in the slums because there's a different world happening different perspective and how essentially like how people can live in a highly constrained environment how do they come together so it's yeah I mean that's wonderful actually a lot of foreigners want to see this okay and last question of the day we're going to end it top five uh top five cities to invest in real estate projects or getting an apartment or buying uh Bungalow or just buying a land some real estate asset like some real estate asset top five cities which you think are growing at a pace so this is coming purely as a developer which might not indicate as a end user like a investor right okay so as a developer I would say Hyderabad Bangalore and then I would say uh Bombay and NCR okay and then maybe I would still stick with four not more as an end as an end user ibad is doing fabulously well and Bangalore is also because wherever the knowledge economy is there things will do well but definitely I'll say the shortcomings in my knowledge is have not studied the tier2 cities as well now you're telling indor indor might be a super place then I was just going to say come to indor I know I really want to indor is a place to be I feel like I'm missing out an opportunity yes you are okay for a developer one of the best cities to invest in is an indor for an end user is one of the best cities in indor and this I'm saying with absolute zero data just personal bias but I'll take it right please don't don't believe me and take it as a financial advice it's my hometown so it's my right and it's my heart saying that this is the best place to do so I would want to do that and I'm putting all my eggs there because I genuinely feel potential there mhm and I just love it more than anything else I just think that that's indor is the place to be thank you so much brother you were really good on this podcast I didn't know where the time flew thank you thank you so much Raj and thank you for having me here and it's great to know you and to get connected to know to your users and share our Industries perspective thank you so much pleas impossible until next episode keep figuring out before you do that Epi because one conversation is enough to bring a change in someone's life I'll see you next time [Music]",

      "[Music] do you feel Market you need to analyze where the supply demand variance and how the country is going to behave there's no Golden Rule major selling point yes important Point without even in the best of the market and in the lowest of the price you still can't s I've seen you know developers or again agents selling things on the paper not few hundreds hundreds of crores but thousands of crores to thousands of investors and essentially those projects will never take off government tenders have cleanly National is more cleaner than State politics plays very important role in real estate in a short term yes longterm no how can someone from a middle class get rich with real estate episode demanded topic that is real estate disc buying in few cities and buying prefer in few cities over rent episode with the founder of asbl aesu before you do that go subscribe rajani Clips or Rani short channel enjo the nice and this you started your parents started what's the scene so basically my I come from Real Estate family background so my father started Ashoka Builders and then we realized that you know right and then we us to have lot of fights right dinner table Jag which my mom used to be the judge of the settlement party so after that uh you know then we sat down one sham and then both of us mutually agreed that it's it's in the best interest that we take a different course of action the different course of action so I then he told okay you go start your own company right uh uh wherever I can share my wisdom with you but it's all yours now you have to start from scratch so then we started in 2017 asbl as full uh Ashoka Builders India private limited I want to ask you a question which is very important especially rent versus [Laughter] [Music] buy see definitely when when somebody is in their 20s they should not buy a house renting is better because there is people need to invest and save and see one thing you look at the other in 20s your earning is also not much so housing is a costly product fin Comfort right as you go into 30s mental sense of [Music] comfort it's a it's a costly Affair cheap AFF cost right unless you know I would suggest people once when you have sufficient money right you buy a house because see any which way every person in the life will Any Which Way buy a house one house at least because it's just the sense of comfort house uh gives you a great sense of comfort but right you know right time like 20s is not probably not the right time 30s do you think especially bbay Bangalore Delhi specifically let's talk about Bombay residential rental 2% correct [Laughter] Lally right let's say I'm running I'm doing a job and I'm I'm making money right uh ultimately my savings have to go and create assets yeah right it might be liquid assets like it can be physical asset like gold or real estate or anything so people transfer their savings into assets that's Point number one next point is so see aage right 5 to 6% inflation right so and then 15% 20% essentially right so when you layer all these things you get a good return very good return it will almost run to 15 to 16% if you want I'll explain in a very simple right had 20 lakhs 80 lakhs bank right and it takes to build the house right and then every year let's assume the house is appreciating at at an inflation adjusted rate of 5 to 6% four years compounding 30% simple 30% right 1.6 into 1.6 into 1.06 into 06 into 06 right so 80 plus 10 lakh 1.3 20 methology so if you are looking at housing asset as an investment this is housing asset as an investment then your strategy should be always buy at the beginning and exit upon getting OC and do this only with developers who have a track record of giving projects on time so yes stocket you invest with companies which have good capabilities top five top index in a 10 year Horizon than real estate see if you look on a 10year horizon right uh there have been I one of my wealth management uh you know friend has sent me a portfolio like he he he analyzed 10 years and he was piing he he broke broke it down into two twoyear windows and he divided that into some 20 assets stock market metal trading agre product trading Tech estc real estate gold Guild everything so at at every different time each asset class performed differently so there is no standardized rule here at all right the thing with Equity see if you look at the index right index performs youl you know good times you make that extra Alpha you make 15 16% also you make it so it purely depends on your particular strategy and you need to analyze at what which point of time where the supply demand variance and how the country is going to behave so there is no straight cut rule if one goes with the straight cut rule they might make the 10 12% but somebody who who customized to themselves or did better research might make more somebody who just blindly put it might lose okay so there is no one you know one single rule there's no Golden Rule okay EST opportun for a young entrepreneur who wants to start a career uh for anyone I'll give by the way 35 and above because then you start making more money and there a sense of stability there's a sense of stability right recently globally including India okay so they did this survey in top 15 countries India included top 15 countries people in their 20s are making more money than people in their 30s true in Last 5 Years True Okay so the whole debate was around this okay there's so much consumption happening and so much spending power has like gone up because people in 20s are making more money mhm so if people are in their 20s are making more money than people who are in their 30s probably they should start logic like they should probably from this logic they should start investing in the house today because the argument on this was a lot of people did this argument that you want to wait and see whether this trend continues no mhm someone who's making too much money in their 20s today will they be able to make same kind of money in their 30s as well and will it appreciate the way it appreciated in the previous decade as well MH but the argument was that because they are doing it in fast Dynamic Quick Change environment so quickly people are making money and then quickly they're going to stop making money as well mhm so people who are making a lot of money in their 20s should be very cautious because in 30s they won't be able to make money because they're careers which didn't existed correct like didn't exist 10 years ago so now there are like new careers for you and that's why you're making demand Supply Gap and then 10 years your carers either will get democratized or won't exist so you need to be very very careful about what you're doing so this was the whole argument and I loved this whole article if you want I can send it to you I loved it correct I I have I have my viewpoint on this I've not read the report but I presume it's right but I think it's it's from a very narrow context right uh definitely I think it's only from the taxation point of view people who are paying tax tax payers in 20s and tax payers in 30 so essentially then they're only taking in people who are working in the knowledge economy right knowledge economy is a very small component of the overall pip coming back to actually this question do you think opportun one opportun maybe second generation entrepreneur in fact the better in our father's generation I've seen this you know like in a small village or a small town or small City where they will accumulate this money the five set 25 and aspiration was different 5 set 25 they would get like a small flat or small something right they would easily get it I'm talking about 20 probably so same estely based on making more money and asset based if break down real estate essentially I would like to break it down into three categories real estate categories three categories from a commercial or enterprising or entrepreneu opportunity perspective right opportunity perspective right one is your traditional real estate appr building right I would say 70% of our business is in that right and other thing next thing is you can you know the entire aspect of see real estate is a very big supply chain right you you can you can cat hold of particular Point Solutions right like for example you want to specialize in uh in sales aspect right how do maybe now there are globally companies which have earned like you know millions of dollars some have even touched billions of dollars so you specialize in one particular aspect M you okay I will not worry about getting land and all this thing I'll only worry about engineering right M I'll get into Contracting space okay engineering is labor issue I don't want to deal with it I'll only get into sales aspect right you can get into getting into Channel partner sales partnership thing or you can get into digital this is one aspect right where one particular component of the supply chain you catch and you excel in that that's one thing there are better opportunities here than the prior one the third one I call is prop Tech right most people don't put it under real estate category but I would like to consider it under the real estate category you can use technology to build great productivity in real estate and then you know you know you can scale much faster so the these are the three aspects the entrepreneur skill the bigger opportunity lies in the third one prop Tech field next is this the traditional there I would say amongst these there's lesser opportunity because it's fairly you don't have a new idea existing ideas already people know it they know better than you so you won't have much space so yeah it depends on which you know what it is if you want to enter the traditional space I don't think there's much opportunity m in fact if you actually see I I met with few in my known Circle my friends uh friends they were they were senior guys in IBM research scientist type and when I asking what is the next big thing like you know because you're working in IBM headquarter so you're the probably the corest of the group there so they were telling see there's only 10% of data available on the internet 90% of the data is not available is what they told I think that even needs to be corrected that 90% May another 90% is not even collected anywhere it's not just Bond so whoever collects those is the next big thing right so a lot of data is just not captured capturing so establishing that is where I feel our Prime business is moving so our traditional business is real estate but our our growth driver is our tech company which is built around you know the application is is a field engineering application okay so it creates a virtual twin and uh you collect a lot of data around it so this data is nowhere collected so using this data we can like you know you like let's say you want to build a 40f Flor apartment a project you don't need to do any you don't need to know anything you just have to subscribe to our neural schema all right so basis on that schema your 40f FL project will be built you don't need to know anything so that's where the future is heading future is heading towards a lot of such models prefixed models and that models need to be validated with lot of data to identify that that's a right model and the company which has such a technology will have a good stint at the future so you feel the new the next billion dollar opportunity for Indians at this point m is to start thinking about no matter which industry you are in mhm just care about how can you collect more data in your industry because that data will give you enough insights to build a large business and large outcome out of it absolutely yes absolutely and still there is 9x opportunity there what has so far happened with Amazon Google Chat gpts and all is only 10% but give me an example of how data can help us out let's say for example I want to make it very clear okay how technology is has a vital role you know in in disrup real estate right but there's a lot of lot of I'm just I'm I'm talking like a 45y old Uncle building is a that way so that it gives more perspective right yes yeah so I so if you look at uh uh what happens day to-day on sites like let's say one of our project it's a live project we are we are building 400 apartments in a project where I'm building 400 apartments in threee Span I'm consuming 8 and a half million to 9 million man hours H right so that's a very huge number of mans with different people different skill sets heterogeneous skill set okay all these 9 million are different uh people with different skill sets at different points of time right now you see the optimization which can be done at such a scale so day-to-day what happens on sites is that laborers come right gang of laborers they might be anywhere from a batch of 10 people to 50 people right and then the project manager or you know allots them work okay your flat number 5506 66 things like that right this process is highly inefficient one when the process when the project manager is telling them which flat or which location in that per se to go he doesn't have the list of all the locations there may be 30 locations but human mind cannot remember the 30 locations second thing these laborers have come at 8:00 project manager time you know he he he didn't come to the site yet they will wait or he just went for his rounds into the project they'll wait so as a 2 three hours in a day just waiting right and then they allocated work and after then again they come back just hours hours hours hours time goes right which is where we created a virtual twin system where this job essentially telling the laborers where to go they know what work to do if I'm a plumbing laborer I not do concreting work right where to go is a very very essential thing which in our company our AI does it's not done by human because of it there's a 34% increase in productivity because why not of because they have they had boost or anything simply because they're not waiting they come to the site they take their equipment directly go to that location 34% our contractor's bottom lines are almost going up by you know 20 22% so what will happen naturally he will pay more for his laborers because he need laborers more because he's earning good profit here so that's what I mean by increase in productivity so using this I'm able to finish my building instead of 8 and half million man hours in 7 and half million man hours so the 10 million Man 1 million manover is a huge value gain that's one aspect where technology is playing a definite role see it's like imagine to put in perspective you know beehive right beehive there is one queen bee and there are millions of soldier bees so think about these as laborers right these Soldier bees goes and does only one task collect pollen store here that's it they're doing homogeneous T what happens in a site is similar but heterogeneous so certain bees certain laborers go and do concrete works certain uh laborers go and do plumbing works like that there are almost all we broke it down to 800 different Works 800 different 800 different works at almost all 3,000 different locations at different points of time now imagine the optimization what can run and imagine doing this at a country scale see we are India's second biggest employer the sector is India's second biggest employer real estate real estate it's India second big first is it no no first first is agre agre agre it less number but right so so if productivity goes up here two things happen one those who are there their wages will go up next you'll free up a lot more laborers who can move into other sectors see there are a lot of sectors where there's deficit of laborers right where these people can be upskilled and go there and they learn much better that's how China grew or any America or Europe in the in the prime years so productivity gains has to happen right this technology will come in huge handy there imagine at a at a country scale see I'm making 400 apartment mototi India will be making around 4 lakh Apartments 400 apartments I'm using mototi around 10 million mans multiply that by what thousand times so you're talking about 10 billion manuvers optimization there that's going to make us rocket speed that will you know take the country's GDP to much higher figures also the penetration of technology in this field is very low and uh India government of India 11 National are run through our digital twin technology and Amad we are doing a Amad Urban Development Authority projects so it's a smart city project so that we are doing and Chennai may also we are bidding so yeah I think we want to it's like this we want the every column to have a voice and speak every road every we now our digital twin is there even in the road sector every 10 met of road to tell about its birth history like that government projects you talked about that these you're taking highways and stuff like that so luckily for us we don't directly deal with the government and with central government I feel it's fairly structured and streamlined and digitized also they've made a portal like Amazon where people can bid and get so we I think with most in that aspect most of the country has become fairly clean really right yeah 20 years back 10 years back things were different government of cleanly significantly I wouldn't say National or State national is more cleaner than state but everything is in a percentage let's say National is 80 percentage state is 60 65 percentage eventually incrementally every year the 5% is becoming cleaner 60% kit tenders are like that's it majority of it is clean should be clean is what I'm thinking come on don't go back don't go back like I I think you need to understand this better yeah I state to state it will vary maybe in certain States it might only be 20% yeah that's what was because my next question was going to be I read a book yesterday I mean some part of book I read yesterday uh it's an advanced copy of a book called Bihar okay biar the politics the business of the entire State and what's going on like so I just read couple of pages in Advan copy I just received it yesterday by an author who's going to publish it soon right certain States I was going to ask you I was like okay hey let's talk see certain States like BR and maybe Bengal like up was there before but now it's totally changed significantly changed I would say but yeah certain I would say economically backward States the transparency is very less so contract or or like just say a normal credible guy also got he might not get payment two things can happen influence your cleaniness of books or your track record what happens yes that happens so that C clearly yes yes that happens what the worst thing You' have seen see at least in the city from which I come from uh and again I'm a fairly new Builder and I've only been in this for last five six years right uh I've seen uh you know developers or again agents selling things on the paper to the tune of not few hundreds hundreds of crores but thousands of crores to thousands of investors and essentially those projects will never take off the investors maybe 5% of them know until now the rest 95% still is okay they don't know the day they know it will become like a massive chit Fund scam or a bank scam Bank Run sort of thing that I think is a little uh you know again this is not again I would say not everybody's exposed there but a lot of people are but 20% of the market exposed to such things is also a big thing so I've seen things being totally you know the way money is taken from The Last Mile the customer uh there I think a lot more transparency can come in and the customer also see they get carried away because of the peer pressure the foro or sometimes just greed right and then without doing their due diligence and it has in fact in our city there's one group I won't take the name but it recently come out in the media 1,800 CR scam SC yeah they just sold project on the paper not more than uh there's nothing which not even a stone moved on the site or probably very little thing has happened on the site so and then 1,800 CR of money was taken from people and then some people took away their FD money or probably some people and all you know took away the savings or something like that and then they ran into some medical crisis and then it was it all came out in the media it was a very big thing but yeah those have to stop those have to stop so that I think is the most I would say recently that I'll tell you specifically around the country happening yes right yes so and either own either they ran away they led the country they're out of fit whatever they're doing or they're so powerful that nobody's able to touch them or they've done it in such a clean way that the company who sold all of this true inoc and I was reading about it definitely this is more in tier 2 cities one cities it has come down drastically years last say come come see as again as the you know developers segment becomes more organized then you have a reputation to lose and all of that it's it it happens a lot less so most of these are done by Fly by Night operators or sometimes even established guys but less chances there probabilistically speaking CER two cities May it's much higher and you go more into District headquarters this is a rampant business model so you'll be lucky if your plot has only one owner you'll be lucky really in smaller District this happens a lot yes it happens because there what happens Naraj because the the local politics Law and Order in a way Judiciary everything is controlled by these people so where will you go and complain what so that's where I feel reforms more reforms as the political reforms and Judiciary reforms if from a real estate perspective I think political reforms I feel I'm happy with it that progressively you're getting better and there is no overnight medicine in this I mean it's practical right but judicial reforms I think is something which is holding back these sectors and failing the last M the person there ready you now that happened right you go and put the case 30 years you'll have to go to the court uh you know the corridors and one you might not have the money second thing after 30 years you only won't be there now so so I think Judiciary has to really up there game you very important question real estate local city cities don't know six seven cars with proper Z Plus sort of security don't know something right I because I was like Wow and then my friend said I was like okay similarly I've seen it in indor most of the big uh big real estate developers I've seen I've seen the same thing in Mumbai I've seen the same thing in Delhi right why is there a case real estate developers like perpetually informally very curious question I was never able to ask this to one of my friends in real estate maybe internal reason I can ask you this and I'm Bangalore hyad but I'll explain the reason why it happens see most of the cases the the people who came into real estate essentially were people who are very close to politics or some sort of muscle Advantage M you had Gund like you had people whom you could tell and they can get it sorted those sort of fields this is one aspect so in in like let's say you you stole land away from somebody right naturally there'll be an angst you never know how they'll reciprocate it that could be one reason second reason is your deliveries with your customers this I'm seeing more this I'm this trend is picking up your deliveries with your customer fail then somewhere or the other they are going to react right when the reaction comes out like this then you need these people to block them that's the why do you need security because if somebody is attacking you you need security politics plays very important role in real estate absolutely I would say if you're close to a politician in your city then you have higher chances of winning in Pol in real estate in a shortterm yes longterm no longterm is exactly the opposite because the opponent when he comes over he'll screw you Oh Real Estate that's why if you look at a lot of well EST you ask even the wisest thing in real estate is don't be aligned with politics at all right because it does so when when you know somebody in you know higher rank in the politics things happen very easily for you and then when the opponent comes then all the easiness will become tough then okay some you know why but then because higher 0% the other guy will feel like you know when you're making this money also right the particular politician is also invested with you right it's not that you have given money and he left so that tangle so you want to go after political V so only if they attack you will that also come out and it happens so the wisest thing is not to be but then do think but then a politician would come okay top floor at this price example I heard this story recently so he can screw you over yes so all of these things happen they do but I'll share the light in this politicians there is some level of fear all across so nobody wants to be caught very blatantly uh committing the mistake right if at all there is see how the politic politician or any I would say the powerful person there how they do is if there is some violation there right then they have an Arbitrage let's say you're 95% as per why I say 95 not 100 because rules suddenly change overnight in this if you're 95% as per rule they also cannot do that or at least in the state or city from where I come from that's the case and one question I always [Music] had MH but on books so black and white according to guidelines proper correct example right books through correct why is it not coming down so is two things first first of all tell you I'll tell you why why one should not buy don't I don't go and buy steel you know inv and again with comes with experience and when you know when when some of the investors were telling me of the stories which they got duped and when I could map them all I realized this in all this projects 30% investment amount 30% most of the chances the project turned turned bad so first low cash right absolutely don't give cash there will be alternates go by alternate there's but there are a lot of people G authenticity local let's say take all that risk rather so I would say strong because you can only claim the account which has come to my bank account really yes and project went bust you want to claim you'll only get 50 lakhs make peace with it% and even if I even if the developer writes a chitty and the customer writes a chitty and you publish in the Cod the guy who has given the cash he'll also go to the jail what happened what do you think what happened in NOA see one thing one major thing called profile financing let's say you are an individual who's earning like 50 lakh per year annual package monthly right and you're eligible for if if you go buy a home you are eligible for let say home loan bu agents loan eligibility right so you come and take the loan the loan is taken on your name right and one Builder Bank 12% 11 to 12% because I'm financing it through home loan I've reduced my cost by almost 30% for 50% almost all right and then I've and to my banker also I'll show it it's a revenue booking I got my Revenue Char flatb B so this artificially inflated the revenue book of a company so in reality what are the sales zero but on book it's four so Banker will put some guidelines okay boss you do 10 sales or 20% I'll give you the next uh 20% of the amount so I'm booking all this to my profile financing and the guy who invested 50 lakhs because I'm also benefiting I'll give you some 25 lakhs or 30 lakhs or maybe another 50 lakhs so essentially that's the check and when when the market became really tough and they're unable to do the regular sales what they started doing they stopped construction and who is the guy who is caught in this you or whoever the guy who who was the profile financer this was very huge because of which because of the availability of profile financing Supply went over the roof and I fin creative financing so there naturally the product Market fit would have been wrong that market is just not ready or just as gross over Supply no product Market fit can do research so naturally strugg yeah very interesting Financial engineering 90% of real estate companies are Financial engineering they're in and trust me they're very Innovative in this just that not all Innovations lead to good outcomes yeah right there an innovation which leads to dangerous outcome this is I do know this this is very new information for me I love it I love knowing about new things this is I don't know why I've never heard about this profile financing and this is the reason why Noida went bust went bust this was one single reason one of the major reasons so why did Noida went bust simple answer profile financing profile financing Yes W the balance sheet is inflated there's no real customer there you know this is happening in Navi Mumbai as well early signs people are looking at this in N Mumbai now profile financing a lot of people bought Navi Mumbai plots and Nai Mumbai K State in a hope that there's a new adani airport which is coming in no which is one of the biggest right but all the major Airlines have declined to operate from there did you know this I that I didn't know why like recently I read the news like 2 3 days ago so Airlines like Indigo which is a major operator which is a major operator they've said no that they're not going to operate from there because of the distance they like they don't have enough demand from Navi Mumbai and Mumbai customers they don't want to send it to Novi Mumbai because it's a major blocker and they lose a major market share so they're not ready to operate from there and if you're not ready to operate from there then they're not money fly exactly so flight airport almost whole airport is going to go bust because if you look at the airport business airport business is not airport business it's a mall business correct you're right it's actually a good way of look the whole airport is a fancy Mall mhm which takes you to your flight muh the whole way is converted into a mall and the bigger the airport the better the revenue because the whole area they have designed it into a mall everybody talks about because the major Revenue comes from these shops interesting so the airport is like a mall and they just want to keep making better better better malls and that comes if you attract the right kind of Airlines okay then there will large majority of money they're going to make through through this this is very very important information I hope people know it through this I didn't know like of course I mean I do though I don't operate here I do follow the news span India I didn't know about this I thought it was a natural thing that it moves to Navi Mumbai city is even I thought even I thought the same thing but I read it like 2 three days ago where they're like adani airports are now trying to convince these Airlines I'm sure they will figure out some way some some way okay I have last uh four or five questions and these are quick more more let's say most Googled question s okay so I want to ask you this major selling point yes important Point without was even in the best of the market and in the lowest of the price you still can't sell so it's that strong uh and in fact when it comes to vastu 80% of it is genuine science it's good for the user of the product Lighting in the kitchen they say is because in the olden days the homaker used to cook right that's her Factory space that's her office space right and sunlight is very important for humans right now we are taking Replacements vitamin D right so 80% is genuine logic 20% in get Superstition so yeah but yeah it's very important very important okay and how can someone from a middle class get rich with real estate hm see fell just like what I mentioned earlier right uh use see real estate may you have to use debt if you don't use debt real estate is not your asset class boss you shouldn't be here right so let's say you're earning 3 lakh salary loan eligibility right you go buy a house right in the beginning with a good Builder again who has a track record and right upon Handover exit you will make your 30 40% return on your uh principal or I mean say 20 22% 20 % you will make on a fouryear component is a lot of money even stock markets don't do that but uh this you need to do it with a good Builder and a good location and right go right when the product project starts and exit right after like once they get an OC plus minus got it okay then very important question I want to know your take on this why are property prices in India skyrocketing in last few years uh okay see majorly I will say uh because there was pandemic everybody were stuffed into the house right and suddenly that's the product which people are using in a day-to-day life what happens you get up use the house for very few active hours if you see you only use for 3 hours and then you're out you're no more no longer using the product in terms when the pandemic was there this product was being used almost 4X more 12 to 15 hours you are active 12 to 15 in a day where you are in the house only so whichever product you use more then you want more of it if you know you you want bigger so that translated into need of bigger space and when you were in your house what were you doing you were working now house generally is not a workspace now you're working so M what you need more space because the house has to give you more functionality right have to go you have to buy a bigger engine or a four cross same thing so now you're doing work out of house so you need more space to compensate for that feature right hence that extra 3400 squ ft right and next at time of pandemic that 1 to two years people were traveling less so more discretionary income on their hand and next thing uh even the interest rates were low back in the day that led to a huge you know sudden uh you know explosion of demand and then it's going then now you see interest rates have gone have definitely increased right so it is build it is bringing again some level of stability but yeah that was the latency and post pandemic the reverse has not occurred it's not that now people pandemic all five days I'll go to office that's not happening right hybrid work is here to stay yeah right and especially most consumers of housing are working in the knowledge economy or the service sector economy so where hybrid econom hybrid work culture is a pretty normal thing so hence the demand is continuing but do you think it has anything to do with NRI buying more houses in India that is also there two reasons yeah that's a good thing what you cited so with n what's happening is one again dollar has appreciated a lot against the rupee so how for us 15 % the prices have gone for for them the 15% has not happened because currency Advantage so it cost lesser for them Point number one point number two there's a reverse brain Rin which is happening a lot of nras especially Millennials do not see themselves to be staying in uh in you know in in US particularly or Europe wherever they're staying for long term they see that there's a lot of opportunity back home in India I'm here working for five six years to make a decent savings and I'm going back opportunity whereas at the same time those economies are S I wouldn't say sinking but they're definitely stabilizing or slightly going towards a lesser growth so they don't see much opportunities so the NRA buying has gone up a lot yes okay then another question ke I want you to be very honest here what are the hidden charges behind buying a house which a normal customer doesn't get to know okay uh I think this this generally even I also when look up online this quite a trending thing surprising thing is in hyad it's very less it's quite you know it's all laid out I think it's particularly NCR and Bombay W question this is okay because I yeah it looks like they didn't charge us more see first one needs to know the basic cost like per SF BOS and then maybe they charger for parkings so parking you need to know are they charging or no next thing is club house and amenities are they charging or no next is then there's a special thing like okay east facing more prefer so east facing extra here it might be some Park View SE view or any view right and on top of this uh check for maintenance maintenance anyways the developer doesn't take but it's something which you have to shut down check for maintenance and Corpus and any other legal expenditure on top of this check for uh when like you know the Clause where let's say invoice is raised and what is the duration what is the penalty let's say developer raises the invoice boss 10 lak 10 lak money pay and then for how long the interest is not levied on that it might be 15 to 30 days invoice credit period after that how much money is he charging as interest check for these things rest to there's only GST and stamp Duty which you will know which which is fairly transparent okay um what do people look in a property before buying what do common people should look in a property uh from a builder perspective tell me see I I'll tell you this bu uh see okay I'll tell you this place see many people miss out two things one they do not really understand how much is it that they can afford and that is where a builder can get the better side of them one needs to and they end up let's say I can afford a 100 rupe product I end up buying a 130 rupe product and that's dangerous for the immediate 3 4 years of my financial life I have to really suffer with that because my discretionary income will be hugely cut off right so that's some area where they can become beu right be very very uh I would say determined when it very very informed when it comes to what is the extent to which you can buy next thing is uh be very very very important you know very uh I would say I have lot of knowledge on what is the flow plan because see the club house and all this now these are like the item numbers in the movie right uh but the story if a movie has to hit you see no movie will get hit because of the item number have you seen any movie none movie gets hit only because of the story so the story in the project whatever one might say oh you got a rooftop pool or pool started with gold I don't know whatever on Earth or facing in case of Bombay overlooking the Arabian or whatever but fall in love with the flow plan only if you because ultimately that's the story you're going to live in the flow plan not on the pool so be very understanding of what is your requirements and will this flow plan solve it now last two questions one is how is Western real estate market is different from India mhm is it see one is from the regulatory perspective both are almost the same this there's lot of I would say localized rules in the west and in India from what the customers point of view do you think people buy more there or buy more here this it really depends uh Raj uh because uh wherever whenever people see opportunity and in the market they participate and real estate is the B it's it's the bucket which has most of your savings especially from middle class to upper class that's where a lot of the savings will go into so that's world over is the same thing right so whenever people see opportunity they move into it in the west what has been happening is there are more conglomerates which have been pushing out the end user right something like your there was few companies that house flipping company and they go and buy off the house and lot of banks like you know Black Rock black stone these sort of guys bought lot of houses so you can't compete with them that happen that happens in so hence I don't know what what exactly how much amount of meat is left for the inducer in India that is not the case good amount of meat is there for the enduser but they need to you know spot it wisely so you can go buy a house for an investment purpose and then flip it and still make a decent return if the opportunity is left in India yeah the opportunity is more in India less invest in that line and second as a buying Behavior India May lot of people buy under construction properties and the banks fund it us that doesn't happen Banks do not fund under construction property they have to buy a ready to move in property so a lot of ready to RTM ready to move in properties are sold more in the US than in India and generically the demand there is less because population is declining and theyve already they have built out houses for most people in but they already have a lot of people who have bought houses yeah that's also there the demographic is also there okay last question a lot of people are exploring a new kind of investment opportunity in real estate mhm which is very big phenomena in US mhm that is Airbnb mhm or Holiday Homes right so in Goa also this has started growing a lot laava started K started happening absolutely what people do is they buy houses and they give it to some management Agency for them to run it on Airbnb or something and then they run it and annually 15 20% they give it back to you correct right do you think it's a good opportunity in India or no it is it is I should more people think about these creative models of Tourism or Holiday Homes like and give it to airbnbs or St Vista or I don't know 20 other companies as well saffron homes yeah it is again is one has to again once they dellve into it they'll realize that okay you can't see essentially what what's happening you are targeting the hotela customer right Hotel May the highend paying customer right so if you if you really make it in a Exquisite manner like a boutique manner you will do exceptionally well there's good opportunity at least for the next 5 to 10 years because India has now begun really traveling so we are traveling a lot within our country so and afford you know affordability is also going people want that Exquisite that good you know that Exquisite experience Boutique experience if your property can give that I mean returns are very good and in fact another Trend which will also come up in line with this is a fractional ownership already it has begun the lot of companies in the space which is doing that that also is going to pick up and with dig ization of land records so land is your land or builtup space is your asset right once the entire ownership of that gets digitized in fact for owning of space it's already digitized your s deed C digitization at least in our state it's there I don't know in various other states but if that once that happens right so the fractional ownership will go for a boom go for a boom tell me top five cities for tourism or holiday home sort of investment opportunities which you see right now in India one to everybody I think it's Goa right I think Northeast has some hidden gems there because of this see when people are going to these sort of things it's very destination based yeah so you know a lot so it has to really you know survive that parameter I think the Northeast and uh has some wonderful opportunities then Goa is there and then the North Region the Himalayas region so either it's Hills or the sea okay that's it yes because these have to be Boutique experience you can't have like this jungle experiences jungle is also a boutique in way but it can't be like okay City TOA experience like you come and build in middle of Bombay I don't think it works bandra view B yeah I don't yeah slum tourism is is growing in India like is yeah I was reading yeah there's a tour on on Airbnb dhavi slum tour oh and which is provided by multiple host now huh and it's every time I see it at least three four of them are almost full every every weekend oh wow I mean that's that's very good actually if people want to see what's happening in the slums because there's a different world happening different perspective and how essentially like how people can live in a highly constrained environment how do they come together so it's yeah I mean that's wonderful actually a lot of foreigners want to see this okay and last question of the day we're going to end it top five uh top five cities to invest in real estate projects or getting an apartment or buying uh Bungalow or just buying a land some real estate asset like some real estate asset top five cities which you think are growing at a pace so this is coming purely as a developer which might not indicate as a end user like a investor right okay so as a developer I would say Hyderabad Bangalore and then I would say uh Bombay and NCR okay and then maybe I would still stick with four not more as an end as an end user ibad is doing fabulously well and Bangalore is also because wherever the knowledge economy is there things will do well but definitely I'll say the shortcomings in my knowledge is have not studied the tier2 cities as well now you're telling indor indor might be a super place then I was just going to say come to indor I know I really want to indor is a place to be I feel like I'm missing out an opportunity yes you are okay for a developer one of the best cities to invest in is an indor for an end user is one of the best cities in indor and this I'm saying with absolute zero data just personal bias but I'll take it right please don't don't believe me and take it as a financial advice it's my hometown so it's my right and it's my heart saying that this is the best place to do so I would want to do that and I'm putting all my eggs there because I genuinely feel potential there mhm and I just love it more than anything else I just think that that's indor is the place to be thank you so much brother you were really good on this podcast I didn't know where the time flew thank you thank you so much Raj and thank you for having me here and it's great to know you and to get connected to know to your users and share our Industries perspective thank you so much pleas impossible until next episode keep figuring out before you do that Epi because one conversation is enough to bring a change in someone's life I'll see you next time [Music]"

      "string": "How to become rich from real estate? I personally believe that real millionaires are from real estate. Now why am I saying this? There is a big logic behind it. See, I said that real millionaires are from real estate. It means that you can say that I want to say that only those people are making money in real estate and money is not being made in the other field. It is not like that. You will also see millionaires in other fields. But I personally believe that a person who starts earning money at a time, after that money starts coming, he definitely invests his money in real estate. So most of the rich people that you will see, whether they have become rich from any profession, any industry, they have definitely invested their money in real estate. The second thing is why is this a real investment? I will also talk about this. Because if a person today is rich from any other business, in fact from stocks or crypto, it is not that he is not rich there. That is also money, that is also real money. But it can be very fluctuating. Today, the value of shares may be very high and tomorrow it may fall drastically. But in real estate, drastic fall downs are less. That is why I gave the biggest statement here that real millionaires are made from real estate. Now today we will discuss two scenarios. The number one scenario is that you want to earn money from real estate, that is why you have come to this video. So either you will have money. So if you have money, one scenario may be that you have money today and you want to invest that money, in fact you want to multiply it, that is why you are watching this video. Or it may be that you do not have money today. But it is your wish, it is your passion, it is your desire that I earn money from real estate and learn to earn money. So now I personally feel that most of our audience belong to a middle class background. And in middle class backgrounds, there is not a lot of money to invest in real estate. So either there is not a lot of money or there is no money. I will take this scenario first. So in this video, we will talk about two concepts. The first concept, as I said that you have money today, how can you become rich from real estate? And that concept will be more important for most people who do not have a lot of money today or do not have money. Why did I say a lot? Because when you talk about real estate investment, then money is needed for investment. If you have a few thousand or a few lakhs today, then you cannot do much in real estate. This is a reality. So you need big money to become an investor. But if you do not have money today, then we will discuss this scenario in detail and then we will talk about how to make money in real estate. So the scenario is clear that you do not have money, no money. And the second thing is that you have to earn money from real estate. Now see, when we discussed that drastically real estate price doesn't go down, I was very clear with one thing and I want to give you the clarity of what I am clear in my mind. I am telling you today. It is possible that what I am telling you exactly today will not work for you today. It is possible that after a few years you will understand these things and you will work on them. So when I talk about real estate, my first focus is on land. flats, apartments, villas, shops, we will talk about all this later. My first focus is on land. Why land? Today, look at India, our population, now The figures say that it has reached around 150 crores. 150 crores. 150 crores people live in India. Now there are 150 crores people in our country. Most of them are young population. Young population has some specialties. What are the specialties? That most of them will earn money and make money. And they have a lot of desires. One of the biggest desires is to buy their own house. Most of the 150 crores people are young population. And they are potential buyers of real estate. And real estate is always made on land. Land is a thing whose demand is still there. And in the coming time, the population will increase. They will get married, have children and the demand for land will continue. So the demand for land is not going to decrease. This is point number one. Its demand will not decrease. And if the demand increases, then the prices will also increase. So land is such a thing that you always have to listen to things. When your family is together in your house, then there is a topic. Do you know what is that topic? How did your grandfather lose his property, sold it, lost the land, or made a mistake at that time by selling it and today its price is this much. There must be such things somewhere that the place where it was, today its price is this much, it used to be ours. So losing land or selling land due to any economic condition is always a hot topic in families. There are very few people who have sold a piece of land and then bought a bigger one. And they are ultimately wealthy, which you are seeing today, so this is very important. So the top wealthy people of India, the top rich people, you will see one thing in common that they will have a lot of land, they will have a lot of land bank, they have a lot of land, and today you think how will we buy land, because it takes so much money, there are many such places in India, like if you talk about Mumbai or any big metropolitan city, buying land is a very big thing, because it has become so expensive. And in the coming time, whether the land increases or not, I am saying the first thing, whether it increases or not, because it takes time to multiply, but its price does not decrease. So there will be depreciation in very rare cases, there is no depreciation on land, because there is very little depreciation on land, that is why it has always been called a safe investment, and it has been called such an investment that if you want to be real wealthy, if you want to be a real millionaire, then you should have land. So although we talk a lot about the stock market, we talk about stocks, there are two types of assets, this is a real asset, that is a paper asset, both have their own value, both have their own advantages and disadvantages, now what is the advantage of stocks, that today you have bought 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 shares, which you cannot buy land from 50,000 in most places, but you have bought stocks of 50,000, if you ever want to sell it, then you can sell it in a day, money will come in your this thing is not possible so soon in land. Here, like we buy stocks, there is a bid, there is an ask, so the difference between bid and ask is that you will always get this difference in real estate in land, suppose a person wants to sell land for 10 crores and the person who wants to buy it wants to buy it for 9 crores, so there is a gap of 1 crore, now they come in between and negotiate somewhere, a deal was made in 9.5 crores, what we are saying, like I said about crores, see it is very easy to say. Now, you might find this video lengthy but I will teach you what I have to teach you today because my point today is that I am giving you this in clarity by watching one video in a day, you will not become rich but you will become rich by taking action on the steps I will give in this video And if you are interested in real estate, then it is very important to listen to these things and sit in your mind So my prime focus is on land, I have told you the reason, population will increase, second thing is safe investment and depreciation is equal to zero, you will always see depreciation Although you will see that land is doubling every 6 years in good places, in some places you will say sir, what are you saying, I have seen it double in 2 years Yes, there is a time, but it is possible that the rate of land may not increase for 4-5 years, but it is possible that after 5-6 years, after 7 years, it will double and jump So these prices depend on many factors, so it is not like stock market, but it is different, but you need to understand this as well Now we were talking that there is no money, sir, you are saying there is no money and we are talking about land, okay, so now I will go step by step Today you do not have money, I told you one thing that your prime focus should be on land prime focus. If this focus is clear then we will move ahead. Today a person does not have money but he wants to make money from real estate. Now you have to understand two ways to make money. The first way is that I have my own investment. And that money multiplied, it became double, triple, five times. This became a great thing. But now there is no money. When we can't invest, then this will not happen. Now comes, we have to earn money. From here comes the point, earn. So real estate is a very lucrative business. In my mind, in my perception, it is clear that real estate can become a very good business. Now how can a person do business? What to do? How to do? We don't know its steps. So now we will talk about step number one. When we are talking about a person who doesn't have money and he wants to make money from real estate. Number one step, get a job. You will say that you always talk about business, self-employment and you are telling me to do a job. Yes. Today there is no money. There can be no investment. So what can happen? Let's understand this. If you want to do business in real estate, then you have to take its experience before that. You have to understand this industry. Now if you go to someone to take coaching, then there are no coaching classes for this. There is no such institute that is giving you training on real estate business. So where will you get to learn from? Tell me this. And why will someone teach you? So the most crash course to learn, you can say, what you will get, you will get in a job. Even if you get a job of ₹ 10,000, but you have to do a job in real estate. Now where do you have to do the job? Let's understand this. Look, there are two segments here, we will understand both. One is that there will be a lot of real estate brokers around you. Brokers mean property dealers basically. Your accessibility is very easy with those dealers. Why is it easy? You can go and talk for a job. It's that simple. Today I agree that there is no money, no skills, but you have time, you have energy, you want to learn. Now go and talk. In fact, you can even say that I don't even need a salary. You will say, why will I work without it? Look, you understand this thing. If you want to learn, you have to pay for it. Even if you don't get money to learn, it will still work. Even then you are in profit. So how will you get money? I will tell you. So one step is that you go to the dealer and say that I want a job. Whether he gives you a job for 10,000, whether he gives you a job for 20,000, whether he gives you a job for 50,000, whether he doesn't give you money today. But you have to do the job. Along with the job, you have to focus on one thing that I should learn as soon as possible. Now most of the dealers will give you the first job, which I am telling you, that will be inventory management. Now what is this? Inventory in real estate, dealers call it inventory. What are the properties in the market? There are many things in the inventory. Land means plots, what are the plots that are sold, what are the flats or floors that are sold Or if people want to give them on rent, then what are the floors and flats that can be found for rent, what are the shops, so this comes in the inventory, which is going to be sold, people want to sell and want to buy, so you will be taught inventory management, number one thing and for this inventory, you may be sent to the field that you go to the field and Bring the number of the builders. Bring the contact number of the people who want to sell their property. So far, people think that a property dealer has opened a shop and there will be someone who wants to sell and someone who wants to buy. And he will mix the two and the brokerage will come. It's not that easy. So this inventory management is the first thing you learn when you go inside a job. If you learn this, you will meet people who already have real estate, property, who want to sell it on rent So, number one, what will be the benefit of this? Your network will be created When the number is being shared with you, then you are coming in contact with such people who are already rich because all these people are rich. A person who wants to give his house on rent is rich. A person who wants to sell plots is rich. All these people are rich and you didn't have rich people in the circle till now. So what is the number one benefit of this job that you will go in the circle of those people who are rich. So sir, there is a saying in English that you are the average of five people you spend your time with. Till now, you were in a middle class background where there are only talks about how to get a good job. They will never say that there is a good job because it is useless. We want a stable job. You see, states like Bihar, Jharkhand are only focused on government jobs, they don't care about anything else. It's a good thing that you are getting a stable job in the government, it's not a bad thing, but the point is that you have seen that there is money in it, you have heard it, you have not seen it yet, I will talk about it later, so what was the first benefit, your network was made, point number two, what is the benefit for you One month, two months, three months, six months later, you will do a transaction. On this transaction, your dealer or broker with whom you were working, who is dealing the property, will share some commission with you. So basically, it happens that there is a lot of standardization in this business. That commission is being charged. What is that commission charging? Generally, typically 1%, 2%. This is the commission. Like if you sell something worth 1 crore, then 1% commission from one side. So if the buyer and seller are of the same dealer, then he will take 1% from the buyer and 1% from the seller. So he will earn a commission of 2%. In the case of flats and floors, there is a commission of 2%. In the case of commercials, there is a commission of up to 5%. So this is a system of commissions. But even if they give you a commission of 5,000 rupees, If you got a job for 10,000 then you will earn 50% commission. But now we were not talking about earning. Now it will take time to earn. You understand what I am saying. Today your situation can be anything. Today you need money immediately at home. But money doesn't fall from the sky. It takes time. Today if someone says that I want to become an engineer then he will do B.Tech for 4 years. Are you ready to learn for 4 years? If not then leave this video here. Today you don't have money, you are not ready to learn, you are not ready to give time and you want to become rich. It is not possible. Today you don't have skills, you don't have talent. Who will give you money? Will you win a lottery or not? In today's time, youth is being misguided so much that celebrities are adding that you can do betting You will get money from betting It is a guarantee that even if it comes once, it will always come, it will go away from your life It won't go away, you will have to do some solid business or you will have to do a solid job So understand this today, what I am telling you, these are not just talks, these are steps in life These are the steps to become rich So you will earn commission on the third day This is the most important When will you get a transaction done? You will see money. I am writing this and this is the biggest point so far. A middle class man has never seen lakhs of crores of rupees in front of his eyes. But when real estate deals are done, See, whatever we say today, Dealing in cash is illegal. Not allowed. But this is a fact that even today there are many places in India where there are real estate deals. Very small amount is given by cheque and most of the amount is given in cash. In your childhood, you must have seen it on TV that money goes in a bag, here you will get to see it and this is the reality, I will make all the things real, we are not talking about the paper In India, there is a lot of focus on transactions through cheques, but have you seen a cheque of 1 crore, tell me the truth, have you seen a cheque of 1 crore signed When there is a credit in the account and the other party says that 1 crore has come, have you ever heard that, if you have not heard it, then from where will you get to hear it, in which business will you get to hear it It will be a very clear thing, because I have seen these things very closely in life, what I would like to tell you, listen very carefully The girl whom you have not seen, how did she come to your mind? The girl you have not seen, how will you have the desire to get her, you have not seen her, you see a girl in college, you feel like getting married to her, become my girlfriend, this is the reality, we are not talking about anything like this, this is how it happens, so today my wife, she was my girlfriend, I had seen her in college, if I had not seen her, I would never have been married, I would never have thought about it, when I saw her, her level was much higher than mine, My level was nothing. But I had to raise my level. Same it will happen with money also. When you see money, you will hear that a deal of 50 lakhs has been made, a deal of 1 crore has been made, a deal of 5 crores has been made. If you haven't heard it, I am telling you now. These things must be looking like nonsense. But when there will be a transaction through you in reality, your mindset will jump. That it is possible. Because today you talk to me at home. Let's say I will earn 1 crore rupees or I will make a deal of 1 crore rupees. So middle class families will say, come to the land, don't think too much. You are not here. You started from a job. You made a network. You made connections. The deal was done. Two rich people, some had money and some needed something. You made them meet. You saw the deal happening. You saw the money in front of your eyes. So you went here. And when you went here, you saw the girl. You will miss her. You will want to get her. And one day you will get her. But if you didn't see the money, how will you get that money? So you need to see money. It is a very important step. Very very important step. Now when you will see money, you will have confidence to make another deal. And how many changes will you get by making this one deal? How many changes will come? I am taking an example of 1 crore rupees because there are more transactions than this and there are less transactions than this. Suppose there is a transaction of 1 crore, you see around you, there is a property of 1 crore, you have a lot more than this, so we are taking an example of 1 crore, so if there is a deal of 1 crore, and you got it done, then you must have some skills in you that the other person had 1 crore rupees and he trusted you that this man will get me the right thing for 1 crore rupees then you must have groomed yourself, so here the fourth which is the biggest thing in you, you will be groomed, so it is very important to be groomed, your skills will be enhanced Now if you have done 1 deal, after some time you will do 2 or 3 deals, it is possible that in a year you will do only 1 or 2 deals, but you think how much effort you must have done for that, how much inventory you must have seen, how many people you must have talked to, how many meetings you must have done Sir, I can tell you that you will get changes from every meeting, from every person, in your confidence, in the way you talk, in the way you make relationships, in your dressing style, there be changes in everything, as you will see people Now the person who is actually rich, if he stands in front of you in a normal T-shirt and jeans, then you will get a feeling that he is rich, so what is it that makes him feel rich, and you are getting to know that he has money, so the person who has money, the person who is actually a real estate millionaire, real estate millionaire, there is no air in real estate, see what it is, in India millionaire, what does millionaire mean, if we talk about Indian currency then it is only 10 lakh rupees And if we talk about the dollar, then if you take the dollar at today's rate of 80 rupees, then it is 8 crore rupees, so a person with 8 crore rupees in India, you can call him rich, but it is not too rich, because here you will see such people, who will have such properties that are more than 100 crore rupees, and you will see those people, they are rich, they know, and they are not just rich, they are rich, There is a lot of difference in this, so the people you see on social media, they more on looking, and these people are rich, even the descendants will be rich, who have not seen new money today, so the people who start earning new money on the internet, you will see that they have wings, so there is such a difference between show off and reality that a person spends more than his share, suppose there is 10 rupees and 8 rupees is being spent, there is 10 lakh rupees and a car of 8 lakhs is brought, so people can say show off here But if 10,000 rupees and 2 rupees are spent, then it is not show off, because they will earn 10,000 rupees and then earn 2,000 rupees, so the expense of 2 rupees is not an expense at all, so what I am saying may not be useful to you, but you will understand them, so if you do not have money today, so my first suggestion is you get a job, so we just talked about going to the dealer, in which your network will be made, you will see money and you will grow up, your skills will be enhanced, There is one more way to get a job, that there are many companies around you, there are builders who bring projects, they also offer jobs. So this is a little different segment but it is also attractive. Here commissions are very good. Like I told you that you get commissions up to 5% So these commissions are very good. Again you have to bring a client. But you always have to keep in mind that what am I going for? Am I going to earn money or learn? So here it is very important for you that who are you working under? So you will definitely get a senior. So if you think that this person can teach me, then take that job or don't take that job. Because learning is very important. So what will you learn here? You will learn one more thing. So as we talked here that you will learn inventory management, here you will learn lead generation That how to generate leads. Now this is not a common lead generation. Because you have to generate such leads that can spend a certain amount. 50 lakhs, 20 lakhs, 1 crore rupees can be spent for a shop, for an apartment, for a floor. So this lead generation of rich people, where will you get to learn? If you do a course, will you get to learn? No, you will not get to learn. Here you will understand what is called cold calling. Cold calling means people whom you don't know. You have to talk to them and convert them for sales. You won't get to learn this anywhere. Here you will get to learn. The salary that you are getting is the expense of your house and if any of your lead is converted and when there is a sale in front of you, you will understand that it is a very different level thing, but now I will tell you a reality. What is the reality? You will see such people who are working with dealers of 10,000, 20,000, 50,000. You will see such people who are working here. But can they all be rich? Not everyone can be successful in any field. There are many such people who play cricket very well. Does everyone go to the Indian cricket team? No I was listening to Virat Kohli's speech and he said that in the beginning he had no idea that he would ever play for an Indian cricket team Because he didn't have a vision. I am repeating Vision need. Those who are not successful, Vision is a very important factor in what can happen. What do you want to earn in life? What do you want in life? What do you want? Vision and vision is not like an apple of Newton that it will fall on your head or when you are involved in some field then you see that vision. Virat Kohli must have started playing cricket then someone must have told that there is something called Ranji and from Ranji people must have shown a vision that they can also go to Indian cricket team so vision will never come while sitting at home. So, for this vision, work is an important thing. What? Vision comes while working. Now, I will tell you a simple step. If you have no money, get a job man. And when you work, you will get a vision. So now climb the first ladder, you will see the way ahead of it. Okay, so I say this many times that one of my cousins was my grandfather, who left me very early. So when my grandfather started driving, he said that there was fog at that time, it was winter time, so he said that as far as you can see, you have to go there first. There is no need to go very fast because you will reach your destination. But sometimes there will be so much fog that you will not be able to see very far. Maybe you can only see a few feet away. So go a few feet, then you will see a little further. You have to move forward slowly, but don't do it that you drive very fast and the car gets stuck. You understand, he said a big thing according to his experience, maybe he didn't understand the real meaning in full detail, but I understood that we have to keep going, we have to go as far as the path is visible, so climb the first ladder, this is important, now let's talk about those people who have money, if you have money to invest Now you explained a concept that people who are in job, who are dealers, they only care about their brokerage They are interested in their commission. If today a person is convincing you to invest money here, invest money here, invest money here, then you have to ask yourself only one question. If I am investing here, will my money double in the next 5 years? And you have to ask the same question to them, if today you are telling me to buy this shop. Buy this floor. Or buy this plot. And you have money. You have money. Will it double if you invest today? You don't have to come just in talks, you need clarity, you need clarity. In the last 5 years, has the rate doubled here and if it did, then what factors caused it? What is the development here? Wherever you want to invest, there is a very clear formula. So here I will give a 3L concept There are three L's that you have to understand before investing in real estate. That is location. location. or location. Buy something expensive in good location, tomorrow again the same is expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same please keep these points in mind Buy something expensive in a good location and tomorrow again the same is probably expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same is expected So, location is the most important factor in Real Estate And then I told you that if there is money First of all, focus on the line. Because shops, flats and floors will be made. Who will make land? No one except God can make it. So land will not be made anymore. can't make more land, what is there is there, so today if the money is less, then add a little more, if it is less, then take a little small land, focus on the land, you will remember my words all your life and with this I think today I gave you a glimpse, I told you that you will not become rich with this video, but one thing is clear, the things I have told in this video and if you take action on them, then you will definitely become rich in life. Real estate is a vast topic, I really enjoy talking about it, I can talk about it for a whole day or a whole month, because I understood this thing very quickly in life that if you want to become a real millionaire, then it is necessary to invest in real estate. Maybe you can't do it immediately today, but add money and focus that I should definitely invest in real estate, there are many people who will tell you that do this better than this, do this better than this, do this better than this. Ask yourself the questions that I told you. Is it practical? Will you become rich from this? If you think yes, then you can comment yes. And you can share this video to spread the awareness. See, if you have less money today, you can invest it in SIP, Mutual Funds, Stocks, it's your choice. If you feel that you are getting a good real estate option, you are getting less than the intrinsic value, then invest. If you want to invest in the stock market today, you can open a Demat account for free. You will get the link in the description and comment box. And when the money is added, then focus on land, man. See you in the next video. Till that time, you can subscribe this channel, click on the notification bell, so that you don't miss the upcoming videos. And for a free Demat account, the link is in the description and comment box. I will see you in the next video. Till that time, you go self-made and Jai Hind.",

      "Now see, when we discussed that drastically real estate price doesn't go down, I was very clear with one thing and I want to give you the clarity of what I am clear in my mind.",
      "flats, apartments, villas, shops, we will talk about all this later.",
      "And if the demand increases, then the prices will also increase.",
      "How did your grandfather lose his property, sold it, lost the land, or made a mistake at that time by selling it and today its price is this much.",
      "There must be such things somewhere that the place where it was, today its price is this much, it used to be ours.",
      "So the top wealthy people of India, the top rich people, you will see one thing in common that they will have a lot of land, they will have a lot of land bank, they have a lot of land, and today you think how will we buy land, because it takes so much money, there are many such places in India, like if you talk about Mumbai or any big metropolitan city, buying land is a very big thing, because it has become so expensive.",
      "And in the coming time, whether the land increases or not, I am saying the first thing, whether it increases or not, because it takes time to multiply, but its price does not decrease.",
      "So although we talk a lot about the stock market, we talk about stocks, there are two types of assets, this is a real asset, that is a paper asset, both have their own value, both have their own advantages and disadvantages, now what is the advantage of stocks, that today you have bought 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 shares, which you cannot buy land from 50,000 in most places, but you have bought stocks of 50,000, if you ever want to sell it, then you can sell it in a day, money will come in your this thing is not possible so soon in land.",
      "Now, you might find this video lengthy but I will teach you what I have to teach you today because my point today is that I am giving you this in clarity by watching one video in a day, you will not become rich but you will become rich by taking action on the steps I will give in this video And if you are interested in real estate, then it is very important to listen to these things and sit in your mind So my prime focus is on land, I have told you the reason, population will increase, second thing is safe investment and depreciation is equal to zero, you will always see depreciation Although you will see that land is doubling every 6 years in good places, in some places you will say sir, what are you saying, I have seen it double in 2 years Yes, there is a time, but it is possible that the rate of land may not increase for 4-5 years, but it is possible that after 5-6 years, after 7 years, it will double and jump So these prices depend on many factors, so it is not like stock market, but it is different, but you need to understand this as well Now we were talking that there is no money, sir, you are saying there is no money and we are talking about land, okay, so now I will go step by step Today you do not have money, I told you one thing that your prime focus should be on land prime focus.",
      "Now most of the dealers will give you the first job, which I am telling you, that will be inventory management.",
      "Land means plots, what are the plots that are sold, what are the flats or floors that are sold Or if people want to give them on rent, then what are the floors and flats that can be found for rent, what are the shops, so this comes in the inventory, which is going to be sold, people want to sell and want to buy, so you will be taught inventory management, number one thing and for this inventory, you may be sent to the field that you go to the field and Bring the number of the builders.",
      "And he will mix the two and the brokerage will come.",
      "So this inventory management is the first thing you learn when you go inside a job.",
      "If you learn this, you will meet people who already have real estate, property, who want to sell it on rent So, number one, what will be the benefit of this?",
      "A person who wants to give his house on rent is rich.",
      "So sir, there is a saying in English that you are the average of five people you spend your time with.",
      "In the case of flats and floors, there is a commission of 2%.",
      "But when real estate deals are done, See, whatever we say today, Dealing in cash is illegal.",
      "So this is a little different segment but it is also attractive.",
      "So as we talked here that you will learn inventory management, here you will learn lead generation That how to generate leads.",
      "50 lakhs, 20 lakhs, 1 crore rupees can be spent for a shop, for an apartment, for a floor.",
      "The salary that you are getting is the expense of your house and if any of your lead is converted and when there is a sale in front of you, you will understand that it is a very different level thing, but now I will tell you a reality.",
      "You understand, he said a big thing according to his experience, maybe he didn't understand the real meaning in full detail, but I understood that we have to keep going, we have to go as far as the path is visible, so climb the first ladder, this is important, now let's talk about those people who have money, if you have money to invest Now you explained a concept that people who are in job, who are dealers, they only care about their brokerage They are interested in their commission.",
      "That is location.",
      "location.",
      "or location.",
      "Buy something expensive in good location, tomorrow again the same is expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same please keep these points in mind Buy something expensive in a good location and tomorrow again the same is probably expected Buy something cheaper in an unused location and tomorrow again the same is expected So, location is the most important factor in Real Estate And then I told you that if there is money First of all, focus on the line.",
      "Because shops, flats and floors will be made."

थर्सडेज यानी गुरुवार का दिन हम फोकस करते हैं रियल स्टेट पर तो आज हम बात करने वाले हैं दिल्ली एनसीआर के दो हॉट लुक केशन के बारे में जब भी दिल्ली एनसीआर यानी नेशनल कैपिटल रीजन में घर फ्लैट प्लॉट खरीदने की बात आती है तो कंफ्यूजन ये होता है दो लोकेशन को लेकर के गुरुग्राम अच्छा यानी गुड़गांव जिसे हम पहले बोलते थे या फिर नोएडा दोनों ही जो इलाके हैं वो काफी पॉपुलर इलाके हैं दिल्ली एनसीआर के हम लोग जो दिल्ली एनसीआर में रहते हैं जैसे मैं रहती हूं दिल्ली एनसीआर में मैं इनके बारे में जानती हूं समझती हूं और जो लोग नहीं भी रहते हैं वो भी जानना चाहते हैं कि गुरुग्राम और नोएडा के कंपैरिजन में कौन सा बेटर है स्पेशली अगर कोई प्रॉपर्टी खरीदने की प्लानिंग कर रहा है रहने के लिए घर खरीदना चाहते हो या निवेश के लिए गुड़गांव और नोएडा के बीच में अगर आपको सिलेक्ट करना हो तो कौन से उन पैरामीटर्स पर आपको ध्यान देना है तो आज हम इसी बात पर बात करने वाले हैं और इस हमारे सवालों के जवाब देने के लिए होम मिट्स के फाउंडर प्रदीप मिश्रा मेरे साथ जुड़ चुके हैं प्रदीप जी स्वागत है आपका मनी नाइन में थोड़े दिन पहले आपने भी गुड़गांव वर्सेस नोएडा एक वीडियो बनाया था तो मुझे लगा आपसे बेहतर और कौन हो सकता आपने इतनी सारी रिसर्च की है शुक्रिया आपने वक्त निकाला इनफैक्ट अगर आप लोग भी प्रदीप जी से रियल एस्टेट में फंस रहे हैं कि गुड़गांव वर्सेस नोएडा में कौन बेटर है किसको कहां निवेश करना है तो भेजिए अपने सवाल लाइव हम रखेंगे अपने एक्सपर्ट के सामने 9311 2874 पर आप भेज सकते हैं सवाल हमारा ईमेल आईडी भी नोट कर ले म 9y tv9.com और youtube2 और गुड़गांव को लेकर अगर आप कंफ्यूज है ना तो आज आपके साथ सारे कंफ्यूजन का हम यहां पर जवाब देने वाले हैं तो हम अपने एक्सपर्ट से बात करें आपके सवालों को ले उससे पहले नोएडा और गुरुग्राम की कुछ की फीचर्स पर एक क्विक लुक लेते हैं नोएडा जाना जाता है एक अफोर्डेबल डेस्टिनेशन के तौर पर यानी कि जिन लोगों को किफायती घर चाहिए उनके लिए नोएडा का डेस्टिनेशन जो है वो पसंदीदा है वहीं गुरुग्राम में रोजगार के अवसर और प्रति व्यक्ति आई अधिक होने की वजह से गुरुग्राम जाना जाता है थोड़े से हाई एंड अपार्टमेंट्स लग्जरी अर्ट टमेंट के लिए हमने अभी कुछ दिन पहले ही देखा कि एक नामी ग्रामी बिल्डर ने 700 करोड़ से ज्यादा की सेल की और वोह भी 1000 से ज्यादा लक्जरी फ्लैट्स की सेल हुई थी गुड़गांव में केवल तीन दिन में तो गुरुग्राम हमेशा से एक हाई एंड प्रॉपर्टी लक्जरी प्रॉपर्टी के डेस्टिनेशन के तौर पर जाना जाता है अब बात करते हैं एक्सपेंशन का किसके पास स्कोप ज्यादा है तो नोएडा में ये स्कोप ज्यादा नजर आता है नए एरियाज डेवलप हो रहे हैं नोएडा में वहीं गुरुग्राम की कनेक्टिविटी अच्छी है एयरपोर्ट के करीब है लेकिन नोएडा ज्यादा पीछे नहीं बहुत जल्दी यहां पर भी एयरपोर्ट आने वाला है रेंटल की बात करें तो गुरुग्राम की कंपैरिजन में नोएडा में रेंटल्स कम है हेल्थ केयर की बात करें तो गुरुग्राम में कुछ एस्टेब्लिश अच्छे बड़े-बड़े अस्पताल हैं एजुकेशन के नाम के भी कुछ अच्छे खासे नाम गुरुग्राम में है तो यहां पर गुरुग्राम बाजी मारता हुआ नजर आता है अब कीमतों की बात करते हैं तो नोटा में एक फ्लैट की औसत कीमत ₹ से 15000 प्रति स्क्वायर फीट है वहीं गुरुग्राम में इससे ज्यादा है जहां नोएडा में आप देख रहे हैं कि चार 000 से जो है वो लोअर ब्रांड है तो गुरुग्राम में 8000 से ₹2500000 में प्रॉपर्टी की कीमतों में 10 से 20 पर की हमने एक हाइक देखी है और गुरुग्राम में यही हाइक जो है वो 5 से 15 पर की रही है किराए में भी अगर बात करें तो नोयडा जो है वहां पे 4 से 5 पर की बढ़ा देखी है तो गुरुग्राम में तीन से चार तो प्राइस और रेंटल के मामले में गुरुग्राम में कम बढ़त इसलिए भी क्योंकि ऑलरेडी वहां पर प्राइस जो है वो हाई बैंड में ही है तो आज चलिए इन दोनों ही लोकेशन के सारी बातों को सामने रखते हैं और समझते हैं कौन सा लोकेशन किसके लिए सही है गुरुग्राम और नोएडा प्रदीप जी इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर अट्रैक्शन और लाइफस्टाइल के लिहाज से कौन से इलाके को आप कहेंगे कि बाजी मार रहा है देखिए प्रियंका जी दोनों एरिया अपने अपने फर पूरी तरह से बाजी मारते हैं कुछ चीजें गुरुग्राम की अच्छी है और कुछ चीजें डा की अच्छी है जब हम प्रॉपर्टी खरीदने के लिए निकलते हैं तो हमें अक्सर क्या हमें सूट करता है हमें एस्पेक्ट सारे स्टडी करने चाहिए क्योंकि प्रॉपर्टी लेते टाइम हर एस्पेक्ट हमारे लिए इंपोर्टेंट होता है तो हर एस्पेक्ट को स्टडी करके फिर हमें हमारे बजट के हिसाब से कौन सा बेस्ट लोकेशन लगता है क्योंकि सिर्फ बेटर होना ही इंपोर्टेंट नहीं है अगर हम व प्रॉपर्टी ले रहे हैं तो हमारी स्कूल से कनेक्टिविटी हमारे ऑफिस स्स से कनेक्टिविटी रहने का स्थान कैसा है वहां की एमेनिटीज कैसी है और वहां से पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट कैसा है यह सब छोटे-छोटे फैक्टर है जो और भी ऐसे बहुत सारे फैक्टर्स को हम कंसीडर करते हैं उसके बाद ही प्रॉपर्टी बाय करते हैं ओके सो आपका बजट कितना है आपकी अफोर्डेबल कितनी है और कनेक्टिविटी पर आपने बात की तो अगर मैं बात करूं कनेक्टिविटी की तो कनेक्टिविटी के फ्रंट में आप क्या देखते हैं कि कौन से एरिया की कनेक्टिविटी आपको बेटर लगती है और कनेक्टिविटी से देखिए आजकल तो टैक्सीस कहीं भी चली जाती है प आप बुक कीजिए पर मैं पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट की अगर बात करूं मेट्रो हो गई बस हो गई तो इन दोनों के ही मामले से और ट्रैफिक के लिहाज से आपको नोएडा और गुड़गांव को अगर हम आमने सामने रखें तो आपको क्या लगता है किसकी क्या खासियत है और किसमें क्या खामी है देखिए जब हम नोएडा की बात करते हैं तो नो डाउट यहां पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट अच्छा है और मेट्रो का जिस हिसाब से एक्सपेंशन हुआ है उसने नोएडा के अंदर एक तरह से मतलब प्रॉपर्टी मार्केट में जान है वही अगर हम बात करें गुरुग्राम की तो जो मेट्रो एक हुडडा सिटी सेंटर तक आई है उसके बाद एक इंच भी मेट्रो आगे नहीं बढ़ी है एक ओ गुड़गांव के रोड के ऊपर मेट्रो सक्शन हुई है ओल्ड गुड़गांव ए के अंदर लेकिन उस पर भी अभी तक काम शुरू नहीं हुआ प्रोजेक्ट सक्शन हो चुका था लेकिन उसके बावजूद भी उसमें एक जो स् पर जो द्वारका एक्सप्रेसवे तक जा रहा था उसको रोक दिया गया और फिर से उसम चेंज कर दिया गया मतलब यह वो हाल है जब प्रोजेक्ट पूरा सक्शन हो चुका है उसके बाद की स्थिति है तो यहां पर मेट्रो की कनेक्टिविटी नोएडा में ज्यादा है गुरुग्राम में कम है पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट की बात करें तो गुरुग्राम में यहां की जो लोकल सिटी बसेस है वही है और मुझे कंपैरिजन में नोएडा में ज्यादा अच्छा पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट नजर आता है ओके सो नोएडा गे थम्स अप जहां तक पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट की बात है क्योंकि मेट्रो ने अच्छा प्रोग्रेस यहां पर किया है गुरुग्राम में गाड़ी थोड़ी सी अटकी हुई है लेकिन जब बात कैपिटल सशन की आती है क्योंकि घर होता है आप रह रहे हो या निवेश के लिए लि हो आपको अच्छा लगता है सुनने में कि भाई मैंने जो है 50 लाख का घर लिया था जो अब मुझे 60 लाख का हो गया है तो कैपिटल एप्रिसिएशन के पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से आपने क्या देखा है दोनों मार्केट में किस तरह का कैपिटल एप्रिसिएशन नोएडा ने दिया है किस तरह कैपिटल एप्रिसिएशन गुड़गांव के बाजार में दिखा है क्या नए एरियाज दोनों में जो है वो उभरते हुए नजर आए हैं स्पेसिफिक लोकेशंस अगर आप कुछ हमारे साथ शेयर कर सके देखिए कोविड के बाद से ही प्रॉपर्टी एप्रिसिएशन मतलब दोनों मार्केट में आई है लेकिन गुरुग्राम में ज्यादा देखने को मिली है उसकी एक सबसे बड़ी वजह जो मैं देख रहा हूं कि यहां पर लोगों ने अब लगजरी में इन्वेस्ट करना शुरू किया लगजरी लोगों की पसंद बनी है और लगजरी के साथ साथ एमेनिटी लोगों की प्रायोरिटी बन गई है पहले लोग एमेनिटीज पर उतना फोकस नहीं करते थे ये माना जाता था कि जितनी छोटी प्रॉपर्टी होगी उतना ज्यादा अच्छा रिटन बड़ी प्रॉपर्टी के टेकर्स कम होते लेकिन अब बड़ी प्रॉपर्टी लोग अपनी लगजरी लाइफ प मतलब बेटर एमेनिटीज जो उनकी हेल्थ से रिलेटेड हो उस पर ज्यादा खर्च करना पसंद कर रहे हैं वैसे कई जगहो के ऊपर यह भी चीजें चर्चा में आती है कि चकि वर्क फ्रॉम होम शुरू हुआ इसीलिए लोगों ने टू से थ्री या थ्री से फोर बेडरूम में जाने की कोशिश की लेकिन फैक्ट ये है कि कोई एक रूम के लिए मतलब वर्क फ्रॉम होम अगर है तो उसके लिए एक रूम के लिए कोई एक करोड़ रुप नहीं देगा तो यह बहुत ज्यादा फैक्टर नहीं है लेकिन हां एक बड़ा फैक्टर है जो कि गुरुग्राम में स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन कम है क्योंकि गुरुग्राम शहर एक अपने आप में शहर है जहा पर एक्सपेंड होने की गुंजाइश नहीं है मास्टर प्लान करीब करीब पूरा 2006 के आसपास आ चुका है वही जब हम नड की बात करते हैंक य स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन है नोएडा के साथ में लगता हुआ इंदिरापुरम वैशाली मतलब पूरा गाजियाबाद है इवन राजनगर एक्सटेंशन का एरिया है या नोएडा के साथ में जो नोएडा एक्सटेंशन के नाम से एरिया बना वो है प्रॉपर ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे ये एरियाज बहुत सारे हैं जहां एक्सपेंशन का स्कोप है जब मार्केट में सप्लाई ज्यादा होगी एक्सपेंशन का स्कोप होगा जब मान लीजिए किसी की अफोर्डेबल नोएडा में नहीं आ रही है तो वो कहां जाएगा वो ग्रेटर नोएडा चला जाएगा उसके यमुना एक्सप्रेस जाने का ऑप्शन है या आसपास के पेरिफेरल एरिया में काफी सारे ऐसे रियल स्टेट हॉटस्पॉट है जहां लोग जाके प्रॉपर्टी खरीद सकते हैं तो इस कारण से एप्रिसिएशन सप्लाई ज्यादा होने के कारण कम हो रही है और यही गुरुग्राम में सप्लाई कम है इसीलिए यहां थोड़ी ज्यादा दिख रही है ओके आपने जैसे जिक्र किया कि नोएडा में आसपास के बहुत सारे इलाके हैं तो मुझे लगता है गुरुग्राम के आसपास भी कुछ नए इलाके माइक्रो मार्केट जो है वो डेवलप हुए हैं पिछले कुछ सालों में अ कुछ नए माइक्रो मार्केट जो इन दोनों ही एरियाज के आसपास हैं वो कुछ हमारे लिए आइडेंटिफिकेशन से कंपेयर करते हैं तो कम है क्या सिमिलरली गुड़गांव में भी कुछ डेवलप इलाके हैं और जो माइक्रो मार्केट नए मार्केट उभर रहे हैं क्या वहां पर प्राइस अफॉर्डेबिलिटी बेटर है देखिए गुरुग्राम से हम थोड़ा सा अगर आगे जाते हैं तो धारूहेड़ा भिवाड़ी ये ऑप्शन है इधर आउटक हो गए यानी ये तो जी जी तो यहां बहुत ज्यादा स्कोप ऑफ एप्रिसिएशन मतलब जो गुरुग्राम में काम करते हैं उनके लिए अभी वो बन नहीं पा रहा है कि वो भिवाड़ी या धारुहेड़ा से ट्रेवल कर पाए देखिए यहां पर एनसीआरटीसी ने जो रैपिड रेल है आपकी आरआरटी जिसे कहते हैं जिसका नया नाम नमो भारत ट्रेन रखा गया है वो एनसीआर में बहुत अच्छी कनेक्टिविटी देगा उसे अभी मेरठ के रूट के ऊपर ही चलाया गया है लेकिन जैसे जैसे वो पानीपत के रूट प या अलवर शाजापुर वाले रूट के ऊपर जब उस पर काम होगा जब वो रेडी होगा तब ये माइक्रो मार्केट बहुत अच्छा परफॉर्म करेंगी इसमें कोई दोरा वाली बात नहीं लेकिन आज की बात करें तो धारुहेड़ा और भिवाड़ी बहुत ज्यादा लोगों की प्रेफरेंस नहीं रहती बल्कि मैं एप्रिसिएशन की बात भी करूं तो भिवाड़ी ने पिछले कई सालों में एप्रिसिएशन बहुत अच्छा नहीं दिया उसका एक रीजन यह भी था अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग पॉलिसी जब गुरुग्राम में आई तो उसने जो लोग भिवाड़ी जा रहे थे उनको कम करके वो गुरुग्राम में बाय करने ल तो ऐसे में माइक्रो मार्केट की अगर हम बात करते हैं तो चकि एक केएमपी कुंडली मानेसर पलवल एक्सप्रेसवे है इस एक्सप्रेसवे के आसपास पांच सेटेलाइट टाउनशिप डेवलपमेंट फाइव सेटेलाइट टाउनशिप की डेवलपमेंट होनी है जो गवर्नमेंट ने ऑलरेडी प्लान की हुई है तो आने वाले टाइम में आपको ऐसी सेटेलाइट टाउनशिप्स मिलेंगी लेकिन अभी बात करें तो अभी वो स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन में उसम थोड़ा सा टाइम दिख रहा है लक ऑफ इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर लैक ऑफ कनेक्टिविटी जो आप हाईलाइट कर रहे थे लेकिन नोएडा के तो कई माइक्रो मार्केटस है अगेन आपने शुरुआत में ही कहा था क्योंकि यहां पर पब्लिक इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर काम हुआ है पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट पर काम हुआ है तो नोएडा के वो कौन से माइक्रो मार्केट है जहां आप देख रहे हैं और कह सकते हैं लोगों को हा आप आप निवेश कीजिए प्रोबेबली नोएडा आपके लिए एक्सपेंसिव पड़ रहा है तो ये नड के इर्दगिर्द ये माइक्रो मार्केट जो आपको दिख रहा है कि बढ़ रहे हैं यहां पर तो पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट और कनेक्टिविटी बेटर दिख रही है आपने शुरुआत में भी कहा था बिल्कुल देखिए एन 24 को नया नाम भी दे दिया गया और बहुत अच्छा उसे डेवलप भी किया गया उसके पास में लगता हुआ पूरा नोएडा है नोएडा के साथ में क्रॉसिंग रिपब्लिक का एरिया या फिर वैशाली इंदिरापुरम फिर एनएच 58 का एरिया है उसको भी मोहननगर के पास में अच्छी कनेक्टिविटी दी गई है एक बायपास रोड बना के ऑलरेडी एन 58 के उस पार्सल को राजनगर एक्सटेंशन के नाम से जिसे जाना जाता है उसको भी बहुत अच्छा डेवलप किया गया फिर जो आपका लालकुआ जो वाली रोड है हाईवे जो एन 24 उसी के ऊपर आप राइट हैंड साइड में देखेंगे तो आपका नोएडा एक्सटेंशन के नाम से वो भी ग्रेटर नोएडा का पार्ट है वो भी काफी अच्छा खासा डेवलप हुआ है और इवन नोएडा के अंदर ही कई माइक्रो मार्केट डेवलप हुई है जैसे 75 से 79 सेक्टर के बीच में या नोएडा ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे के बीच में पीछे जब जेपी थोड़ा सा कई इशू आए तो वहां कई प्रोजेक्ट रुके लेकिन बाद में वो प्रोजेक्ट अब रिवाइव होने शुरू हो रहे हैं क्योंकि वहां पर सुरक्षा ग्रुप टेकओवर कर रहा है तो ऐसे में वो माइक्रो मार्केट में भी काम हुआ है या सेक्टर 137 की मार्केट देखें तो उन माइक्रो मार्केट में भी काम हुआ है और वहां पर भी पिछले कई सालों में अच्छी एप्रिसिएशन देखने को मिली है और नोएडा से हम थोड़ा सा आगे बढ़ते हैं तो यमुना एक्सप्रेसवे का एरिया ये भी एक अपने आप में प्राइम एरिया है जो जेवर एयरपोर्ट का बेनिफिट जिसे उस एरिया में मिल रहा है और वहां पर भी अच्छी खासी प्रॉपर्टी बाइंग हो रही है ओके सो हम नोयडा का अच्छा खासा एक्सपेंशन देख रहे हैं इसके आसपास हम देख रहे हैं कई माइक्रो मार्केट जो नेशनल हाईवे 24 के इर्दगिर्द कई इलाके हैं एक्सप्रेसवे के इर्दगिर्द के इलाके हैं जो डेवलप हो रहे हैं और व्ट आई अंडरस्टैंड प्रदीप जी यानी कि माइक्रो मार्केट जो नए उभरते हुए इलाके हैं इसमें नोएडा तो बाजी मारते हुए नजर आ रहा है क्योंकि यहां पर अगर आप निवेश करेंगे तो आपको शायद अपसन भी मिलेगा और आपकी शुरुआती निवेश अभी अगर अफोर्डेबल भी आपको प्राइसेस मिल जाएंगे राइट देखिए जब इसकी बात आती है तो चकि यहां एमएनसी और कॉर्पोरेट जो फ 500 कंपनीज है उन्होंने गुरुग्राम को पहले पसंद किया क्योंकि यहां एयरपोर्ट ऑलरेडी डेवलप है जेवर बनेगा एप्रिसिएशन के लिए आप उन एरिया में जा सकते हैं लेकिन किसी भी एरिया को बसने के लिए करीब करीब 20 साल का समय देना पड़ता है यह ट्रेंड है ये शुरू से हम सब देखते आ रहे हैं तो बहुत इमीडिएट में कहूंगा बहुत अच्छा डेवलपमेंट नहीं ओके सर की आवाज जो है वो थोड़ी सी अभी ब्रेक हो गई जी हां आपकी आवाज आ रही है प्रदीप सर लेकिन गुरुग्राम के अंदर ये ऑप्शन मैं कहूंगा कि बहुत लिमिटेड है और यहां स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन जैसे दिख भी रहा है क्योंकि यहां एमएनसी कॉर्पोरेट जो फ्य 500 कंपनीज है जो इंडिया में इन्वेस्ट करना चाहती है इंडिया में काम करना चाहती है उन्होंने गुरुग्राम को बेस बनाया है तो यही रीजन है पर कैपिटा इनकम भी ज्यादा है यहां और लोगों की चॉइस भी वैसी है तो ऐसा नहीं है गुरुग्राम में कहीं कोई कम स्कोप है लेकिन हां जो स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन है जो एरिया की एरिया के बढ़ने की बात करेंगे तो वो नोएडा के अंदर ज्यादा जरूर नजर आता है ठीक है अब मैं अफॉर्डेबिलिटी पर आऊंगी और सीधा आपसे अगर पूछूंगी कि एक थ्र बीएच के फ्लैट की अपक्स अप्रॉक्स कीमत जो है वो गुड़गांव में कितनी होगी और नोएडा में कितनी होगी देखिए ी बीएचके की अगर हम बात करें तो एप्रोक्सीमेटली अब जो करंट सिनेरियो में रेट आ गए हैं गुरुग्राम के वो करीब करीब 15 से लेकर 00 पर फीट पर आ गए और बी के अगर हम 1800 या 2000 स्क्वा फीट का फ्लैट लेकर चलते हैं तो आप समझ सकते हैं कि यही प्रॉपर्टी करीब करीब तीन सा करोड़ रुप की रेंज में अब आ चुकी है वही अगर हम नोएडा में बात करें तो नोएडा ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे इस टाइम प जो प्रीवेलिंग रेट है वो करीब करीब 12 से 15 हज पर स्क्वा फीट के आसपास आ चुके हैं तो हम अगर उसी को लेकर चले 2000 स्क्वा फीट के प्रॉपर्टी की बात करें तो यह प्रॉपर्टी भी करीब करीब हमें ढाई करोड़ के आसपास की ढाई से ती करोड़ के बीच में पढ़ती है तो नोएडा ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे भी उसी तरह से आगे अप्रिशिएट हो रहा है यहां थोड़ा सा मैंने आपको जो कंसर्न बताया पर कैपिटा इनकम का बताया लेकिन स्कोप ऑफ एप्रिसिएशन जिस तरह से रेट नोएडा के थे तो उस तरह से एप्रिसिएशन नड में भी दिख रही है ओके अब ये बताइए रेंटल से कमाई लोग पसंद करते हैं भाई एक निवेश करते हैं जिससे उन्हें रेंटल इनकम हो सके तो किराए से अगर कोई कमाई करना चाहता है तो रेंटल ल्ड के मामले में गुरुग्राम और नोएडा में क्या अंतर है देखिए जब हम रेंटल की बात करते हैं तो रेंटल ओवरऑल 2 पर के आसपास रहता है लेकिन तब भी मैं कहूंगा कि अफोर्डेबल नोएडा के अंदर ज्यादा है क्योंकि यहां प्राइस भी कम है हम उस प्राइस के ऊपर जब दो पर लगाते हैं तो यहां पे अफॉर्डेबिलिटी अपने आप नजर आ जाती है फिर दूसरी बात यहां पे अब तक जो प्रोजेक्ट है उनमें एफआर काफी ज्यादा है मतलब तीन साढ़े की एफआर प करीब करीब यहां प्रोजेक्ट बन रहे हैं तो चकि नंबर अपार्टमेंट ज्यादा होते हैं तो इसीलिए डेवलपर थोड़ा नीचे के रेट प उसे सेल भी कर पाते हैं तो प्रॉपर्टी की वैल्यू उसे कैलकुलेट करेंगे तो रेंटल हमें नोएडा में रीजनेबल मिलेंगे और गुरुग्राम में चकि एफआर 1.75 रेगुलर है अब जो नए प्रोजेक्ट आ रहे हैं वहां गवर्नमेंट ने स्कोप बढ़ाया है जैसे कि जो डेंसिटी थी करीब करीब कंज्यूम हो चुकी थी उसके बाद अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग की जरूरत दिखी तो अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग के लिए पहले 10 और फिर 5 पर एडिशनल मतलब एक सेक्टर के अंदर ग्रुप हाउसिंग जैसे 20 पर होता है तो उसको 10 पर एडिशनल एरिया दिया गया कि अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग बन सके फिर 5 पर एडिशनल एरिया फिर से दिया गया कि अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग बन सके उसके बाद जो एक्सप्रेसवे जैसी लोकेशन है या मेट्रो जैसी लोकेश है वहां पर टीडी अप्लाई ट्रांजिट ओरिएंटेड डेवलपमेंट होती है वर्क टू होम कल्चर को डेवलप करने के लिए अथॉरिटीज एडिशन एफआर देती है तो वो एडिशनल एफआर टीडी वाला जो पर्पस है वो अब धीरे-धीरे गुरुग्राम में आना शुरू हुआ है तो अब यहां पर भी वो आपको सप्लाई आने वाले टाइम में ज्यादा दिख सकती है जो एक्सप्रेसवे के आसपास की लोकेशन है जैसे कि मैंने बताया डेंसिटी ऑलमोस्ट खत्म हो चुकी थी अब लेकिन चकि टीडी है या एक नया जो अथॉरिटी ने एन आईएल पी न्यू इंटीग्रेटेड लाइसेंसिंग पॉलिसी प वर्क करके एडिशनल स्कोप दिया कि सप्लाई आ सके तो इससे अब सप्लाई और रेंटल अब आने वाले टाइम में हो सकता है थोड़ा सा रीजनेबल हो लेकिन फिलहाल रेंटल में यहां पर भी अच्छी खासी डेवलपमेंट देखने को मिली है मैं कहूंगा कि 2 पर से अब बढ़कर करीब करीब रेंटल यहां 2 पर के आसपास प्रॉपर्टी वैल्यू का दिख रहा है तो अभी एट दिस पॉइंट नोएडा रेंटल ल्ड में आगे है जी ओके न नड रीजनेबल है नइड रीजनेबल है नहीं पर अगर कोई निवेश करता है आने वाले समय में उसे उससे कमाई जब होगी तो उसकी जो रेंटल यील्ड होगी वो बेटर रहेगी रेंटल यील्ड अभी भी हमें गुरुग्राम में ज्यादा बेटर मिले ओके ठीक है अब एक अंतर जो दोनों लोकेशन में है वो है प्रॉपर्टी के टाइप को लेकर के नोएडा और ग्रेटर नोएडा में प्रॉपर्टी लीज होल्ड है और गुरुग्राम में प्रॉपर्टी फ्री होल्ड होती है तो ऐसे में आप घर खरीदारों को किस शहर में प्रॉपर्टी खरीदने की सलाह देते हैं इन दोनों में क्या अंतर होता है यह भी समझा दीजिए देखिए लीज और प्रॉपर्टी मतलब अथॉरिटी की प्रॉपर्टी है अथॉरिटी उसे लॉन्ग टर्म लीस प देती है मतलब एस गुड एस प्रॉपर्टी आप कर रहे कोई बहुत ज्यादा इसमें दिक्कत नजर नहीं आती और उसी प्रकार से गुरुग्राम में फ्री होल्ड प्रॉपर्टी है तो वहां पर किसी टाइप का आपका रेगुलर लीज रेंट नहीं जाता है तो इतना ही डिफरेंस है मतलब दोनों में प्रॉपर्टी की ओनरशिप करीब करीब आपके पास ही है इसमें ऐसी कोई मुझे बहुत ज्यादा डिफरेंस नजर नहीं आता तो इसीलिए घर खरीदार को इसमें बहुत ज्यादा कुछ सोचने की जरूरत नहीं है ठीक है तो लेकिन स्टम ड्यूटी और रजिस्ट्रेशन चार्ज इनम कितना फर्क है दोनों शहरों में करीब करीब बराबर है यहां पर डिफरेंस तब आता है जब प्रॉपर्टी फीमेल के नाम प खरीदी जाती है फीमेल के नाम पर प्रॉपर्टी में करीब करीब 2 पर का रिबेट हरियाणा के अंदर है और यही हम बात करें नोएडा की या यूपी की बात करें तो यहां पर फर्स्ट 10 लाख की प्रॉपर्टी प 10000 का रिबेट है मतलब 1 पर का रिबेट है जो कि टोटल 10000 का रिपेड स्टम ड्यूटी के ऊपर पड़ता है तो बहुत ज्यादा डिफरेंस नोएडा के अंदर फीमेल के नाम पर अगर प्रॉपर्टी खरीदते हैं तो उसके अंदर बहुत ज्यादा डिफरेंस नजर नहीं आता [संगीत] है",

आती है तो कंफ्यूजन ये होता है दो लोकेशन को लेकर के गुरुग्राम अच्छा यानी गुड़गांव जिसे हम पहले बोलते थे या फिर नोएडा दोनों ही जो इलाके हैं वो काफी पॉपुलर इलाके हैं दिल्ली एनसीआर के हम लोग जो दिल्ली एनसीआर में रहते हैं जैसे मैं रहती हूं दिल्ली एनसीआर में मैं इनके बारे में जानती हूं समझती हूं और जो लोग नहीं भी रहते हैं वो भी जानना चाहते हैं कि गुरुग्राम और नोएडा के कंपैरिजन में कौन सा बेटर है स्पेशली अगर कोई प्रॉपर्टी खरीदने की प्लानिंग कर रहा है रहने के लिए घर खरीदना चाहते हो या निवेश के लिए गुड़गांव और नोएडा के बीच में अगर आपको सिलेक्ट करना हो तो कौन से उन पैरामीटर्स पर आपको ध्यान देना है तो आज हम इसी बात पर बात करने वाले हैं और इस हमारे सवालों के जवाब देने के लिए होम मिट्स के फाउंडर प्रदीप मिश्रा मेरे साथ जुड़ चुके हैं प्रदीप जी स्वागत है आपका मनी नाइन में थोड़े दिन पहले आपने भी गुड़गांव वर्सेस नोएडा एक वीडियो बनाया था तो मुझे लगा आपसे बेहतर और कौन हो सकता आपने इतनी सारी रिसर्च की है शुक्रिया आपने वक्त निकाला इनफैक्ट अगर आप लोग भी प्रदीप जी से रियल एस्टेट में फंस रहे हैं कि गुड़गांव वर्सेस नोएडा में कौन बेटर है किसको कहां निवेश करना है तो भेजिए अपने सवाल लाइव हम रखेंगे अपने एक्सपर्ट के सामने 9311 2874 पर आप भेज सकते हैं सवाल हमारा ईमेल आईडी भी नोट कर ले म 9y tv9.com और youtube2 और गुड़गांव को लेकर अगर आप कंफ्यूज है ना तो आज आपके साथ सारे कंफ्यूजन का हम यहां पर जवाब देने वाले हैं तो हम अपने एक्सपर्ट से बात करें आपके सवालों को ले उससे पहले नोएडा और गुरुग्राम की कुछ की फीचर्स पर एक क्विक लुक लेते हैं नोएडा जाना जाता है एक अफोर्डेबल डेस्टिनेशन के तौर पर यानी कि जिन लोगों को किफायती घर चाहिए उनके लिए नोएडा का डेस्टिनेशन जो है वो पसंदीदा है वहीं गुरुग्राम में रोजगार के अवसर और प्रति व्यक्ति आई अधिक होने की वजह से गुरुग्राम जाना जाता है थोड़े से हाई एंड अपार्टमेंट्स लग्जरी अर्ट टमेंट के लिए हमने अभी कुछ दिन पहले ही देखा कि एक नामी ग्रामी बिल्डर ने 700 करोड़ से ज्यादा की सेल की और वोह भी 1000 से ज्यादा लक्जरी फ्लैट्स की सेल हुई थी गुड़गांव में केवल तीन दिन में तो गुरुग्राम हमेशा से एक हाई एंड प्रॉपर्टी लक्जरी प्रॉपर्टी के डेस्टिनेशन के तौर पर जाना जाता है अब बात करते हैं एक्सपेंशन का किसके पास स्कोप ज्यादा है तो नोएडा में ये स्कोप ज्यादा नजर आता है नए एरियाज डेवलप हो रहे हैं नोएडा में वहीं गुरुग्राम की कनेक्टिविटी अच्छी है एयरपोर्ट के करीब है लेकिन नोएडा ज्यादा पीछे नहीं बहुत जल्दी यहां पर भी एयरपोर्ट आने वाला है रेंटल की बात करें तो गुरुग्राम की कंपैरिजन में नोएडा में रेंटल्स कम है हेल्थ केयर की बात करें तो गुरुग्राम में कुछ एस्टेब्लिश अच्छे बड़े-बड़े अस्पताल हैं एजुकेशन के नाम के भी कुछ अच्छे खासे नाम गुरुग्राम में है तो यहां पर गुरुग्राम बाजी मारता हुआ नजर आता है अब कीमतों की बात करते हैं तो नोटा में एक फ्लैट की औसत कीमत ₹ से 15000 प्रति स्क्वायर फीट है वहीं गुरुग्राम में इससे ज्यादा है जहां नोएडा में आप देख रहे हैं कि चार 000 से जो है वो लोअर ब्रांड है तो गुरुग्राम में 8000 से ₹2500000 में प्रॉपर्टी की कीमतों में 10 से 20 पर की हमने एक हाइक देखी है और गुरुग्राम में यही हाइक जो है वो 5 से 15 पर की रही है किराए में भी अगर बात करें तो नोयडा जो है वहां पे 4 से 5 पर की बढ़ा देखी है तो गुरुग्राम में तीन से चार तो प्राइस और रेंटल के मामले में गुरुग्राम में कम बढ़त इसलिए भी क्योंकि ऑलरेडी वहां पर प्राइस जो है वो हाई बैंड में ही है तो आज चलिए इन दोनों ही लोकेशन के सारी बातों को सामने रखते हैं और समझते हैं कौन सा लोकेशन किसके लिए सही है गुरुग्राम और नोएडा प्रदीप जी इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर अट्रैक्शन और लाइफस्टाइल के लिहाज से कौन से इलाके को आप कहेंगे कि बाजी मार रहा है देखिए प्रियंका जी दोनों एरिया अपने अपने फर पूरी तरह से बाजी मारते हैं कुछ चीजें गुरुग्राम की अच्छी है और कुछ चीजें डा की अच्छी है जब हम प्रॉपर्टी खरीदने के लिए निकलते हैं तो हमें अक्सर क्या हमें सूट करता है हमें एस्पेक्ट सारे स्टडी करने चाहिए क्योंकि प्रॉपर्टी लेते टाइम हर एस्पेक्ट हमारे लिए इंपोर्टेंट होता है तो हर एस्पेक्ट को स्टडी करके फिर हमें हमारे बजट के हिसाब से कौन सा बेस्ट लोकेशन लगता है क्योंकि सिर्फ बेटर होना ही इंपोर्टेंट नहीं है अगर हम व प्रॉपर्टी ले रहे हैं तो हमारी स्कूल से कनेक्टिविटी हमारे ऑफिस स्स से कनेक्टिविटी रहने का स्थान कैसा है वहां की एमेनिटीज कैसी है और वहां से पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट कैसा है यह सब छोटे-छोटे फैक्टर है जो और भी ऐसे बहुत सारे फैक्टर्स को हम कंसीडर करते हैं उसके बाद ही प्रॉपर्टी बाय करते हैं ओके सो आपका बजट कितना है आपकी अफोर्डेबल कितनी है और कनेक्टिविटी पर आपने बात की तो अगर मैं बात करूं कनेक्टिविटी की तो कनेक्टिविटी के फ्रंट में आप क्या देखते हैं कि कौन से एरिया की कनेक्टिविटी आपको बेटर लगती है और कनेक्टिविटी से देखिए आजकल तो टैक्सीस कहीं भी चली जाती है प आप बुक कीजिए पर मैं पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट की अगर बात करूं मेट्रो हो गई बस हो गई तो इन दोनों के ही मामले से और ट्रैफिक के लिहाज से आपको नोएडा और गुड़गांव को अगर हम आमने सामने रखें तो आपको क्या लगता है किसकी क्या खासियत है और किसमें क्या खामी है देखिए जब हम नोएडा की बात करते हैं तो नो डाउट यहां पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट अच्छा है और मेट्रो का जिस हिसाब से एक्सपेंशन हुआ है उसने नोएडा के अंदर एक तरह से मतलब प्रॉपर्टी मार्केट में जान है वही अगर हम बात करें गुरुग्राम की तो जो मेट्रो एक हुडडा सिटी सेंटर तक आई है उसके बाद एक इंच भी मेट्रो आगे नहीं बढ़ी है एक ओ गुड़गांव के रोड के ऊपर मेट्रो सक्शन हुई है ओल्ड गुड़गांव ए के अंदर लेकिन उस पर भी अभी तक काम शुरू नहीं हुआ प्रोजेक्ट सक्शन हो चुका था लेकिन उसके बावजूद भी उसमें एक जो स् पर जो द्वारका एक्सप्रेसवे तक जा रहा था उसको रोक दिया गया और फिर से उसम चेंज कर दिया गया मतलब यह वो हाल है जब प्रोजेक्ट पूरा सक्शन हो चुका है उसके बाद की स्थिति है तो यहां पर मेट्रो की कनेक्टिविटी नोएडा में ज्यादा है गुरुग्राम में कम है पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट की बात करें तो गुरुग्राम में यहां की जो लोकल सिटी बसेस है वही है और मुझे कंपैरिजन में नोएडा में ज्यादा अच्छा पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट नजर आता है ओके सो नोएडा गे थम्स अप जहां तक पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट की बात है क्योंकि मेट्रो ने अच्छा प्रोग्रेस यहां पर किया है गुरुग्राम में गाड़ी थोड़ी सी अटकी हुई है लेकिन जब बात कैपिटल सशन की आती है क्योंकि घर होता है आप रह रहे हो या निवेश के लिए लि हो आपको अच्छा लगता है सुनने में कि भाई मैंने जो है 50 लाख का घर लिया था जो अब मुझे 60 लाख का हो गया है तो कैपिटल एप्रिसिएशन के पॉइंट ऑफ व्यू से आपने क्या देखा है दोनों मार्केट में किस तरह का कैपिटल एप्रिसिएशन नोएडा ने दिया है किस तरह कैपिटल एप्रिसिएशन गुड़गांव के बाजार में दिखा है क्या नए एरियाज दोनों में जो है वो उभरते हुए नजर आए हैं स्पेसिफिक लोकेशंस अगर आप कुछ हमारे साथ शेयर कर सके देखिए कोविड के बाद से ही प्रॉपर्टी एप्रिसिएशन मतलब दोनों मार्केट में आई है लेकिन गुरुग्राम में ज्यादा देखने को मिली है उसकी एक सबसे बड़ी वजह जो मैं देख रहा हूं कि यहां पर लोगों ने अब लगजरी में इन्वेस्ट करना शुरू किया लगजरी लोगों की पसंद बनी है और लगजरी के साथ साथ एमेनिटी लोगों की प्रायोरिटी बन गई है पहले लोग एमेनिटीज पर उतना फोकस नहीं करते थे ये माना जाता था कि जितनी छोटी प्रॉपर्टी होगी उतना ज्यादा अच्छा रिटन बड़ी प्रॉपर्टी के टेकर्स कम होते लेकिन अब बड़ी प्रॉपर्टी लोग अपनी लगजरी लाइफ प मतलब बेटर एमेनिटीज जो उनकी हेल्थ से रिलेटेड हो उस पर ज्यादा खर्च करना पसंद कर रहे हैं वैसे कई जगहो के ऊपर यह भी चीजें चर्चा में आती है कि चकि वर्क फ्रॉम होम शुरू हुआ इसीलिए लोगों ने टू से थ्री या थ्री से फोर बेडरूम में जाने की कोशिश की लेकिन फैक्ट ये है कि कोई एक रूम के लिए मतलब वर्क फ्रॉम होम अगर है तो उसके लिए एक रूम के लिए कोई एक करोड़ रुप नहीं देगा तो यह बहुत ज्यादा फैक्टर नहीं है लेकिन हां एक बड़ा फैक्टर है जो कि गुरुग्राम में स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन कम है क्योंकि गुरुग्राम शहर एक अपने आप में शहर है जहा पर एक्सपेंड होने की गुंजाइश नहीं है मास्टर प्लान करीब करीब पूरा 2006 के आसपास आ चुका है वही जब हम नड की बात करते हैंक य स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन है नोएडा के साथ में लगता हुआ इंदिरापुरम वैशाली मतलब पूरा गाजियाबाद है इवन राजनगर एक्सटेंशन का एरिया है या नोएडा के साथ में जो नोएडा एक्सटेंशन के नाम से एरिया बना वो है प्रॉपर ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे ये एरियाज बहुत सारे हैं जहां एक्सपेंशन का स्कोप है जब मार्केट में सप्लाई ज्यादा होगी एक्सपेंशन का स्कोप होगा जब मान लीजिए किसी की अफोर्डेबल नोएडा में नहीं आ रही है तो वो कहां जाएगा वो ग्रेटर नोएडा चला जाएगा उसके यमुना एक्सप्रेस जाने का ऑप्शन है या आसपास के पेरिफेरल एरिया में काफी सारे ऐसे रियल स्टेट हॉटस्पॉट है जहां लोग जाके प्रॉपर्टी खरीद सकते हैं तो इस कारण से एप्रिसिएशन सप्लाई ज्यादा होने के कारण कम हो रही है और यही गुरुग्राम में सप्लाई कम है इसीलिए यहां थोड़ी ज्यादा दिख रही है ओके आपने जैसे जिक्र किया कि नोएडा में आसपास के बहुत सारे इलाके हैं तो मुझे लगता है गुरुग्राम के आसपास भी कुछ नए इलाके माइक्रो मार्केट जो है वो डेवलप हुए हैं पिछले कुछ सालों में अ कुछ नए माइक्रो मार्केट जो इन दोनों ही एरियाज के आसपास हैं वो कुछ हमारे लिए आइडेंटिफिकेशन से कंपेयर करते हैं तो कम है क्या सिमिलरली गुड़गांव में भी कुछ डेवलप इलाके हैं और जो माइक्रो मार्केट नए मार्केट उभर रहे हैं क्या वहां पर प्राइस अफॉर्डेबिलिटी बेटर है देखिए गुरुग्राम से हम थोड़ा सा अगर आगे जाते हैं तो धारूहेड़ा भिवाड़ी ये ऑप्शन है इधर आउटक हो गए यानी ये तो जी जी तो यहां बहुत ज्यादा स्कोप ऑफ एप्रिसिएशन मतलब जो गुरुग्राम में काम करते हैं उनके लिए अभी वो बन नहीं पा रहा है कि वो भिवाड़ी या धारुहेड़ा से ट्रेवल कर पाए देखिए यहां पर एनसीआरटीसी ने जो रैपिड रेल है आपकी आरआरटी जिसे कहते हैं जिसका नया नाम नमो भारत ट्रेन रखा गया है वो एनसीआर में बहुत अच्छी कनेक्टिविटी देगा उसे अभी मेरठ के रूट के ऊपर ही चलाया गया है लेकिन जैसे जैसे वो पानीपत के रूट प या अलवर शाजापुर वाले रूट के ऊपर जब उस पर काम होगा जब वो रेडी होगा तब ये माइक्रो मार्केट बहुत अच्छा परफॉर्म करेंगी इसमें कोई दोरा वाली बात नहीं लेकिन आज की बात करें तो धारुहेड़ा और भिवाड़ी बहुत ज्यादा लोगों की प्रेफरेंस नहीं रहती बल्कि मैं एप्रिसिएशन की बात भी करूं तो भिवाड़ी ने पिछले कई सालों में एप्रिसिएशन बहुत अच्छा नहीं दिया उसका एक रीजन यह भी था अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग पॉलिसी जब गुरुग्राम में आई तो उसने जो लोग भिवाड़ी जा रहे थे उनको कम करके वो गुरुग्राम में बाय करने ल तो ऐसे में माइक्रो मार्केट की अगर हम बात करते हैं तो चकि एक केएमपी कुंडली मानेसर पलवल एक्सप्रेसवे है इस एक्सप्रेसवे के आसपास पांच सेटेलाइट टाउनशिप डेवलपमेंट फाइव सेटेलाइट टाउनशिप की डेवलपमेंट होनी है जो गवर्नमेंट ने ऑलरेडी प्लान की हुई है तो आने वाले टाइम में आपको ऐसी सेटेलाइट टाउनशिप्स मिलेंगी लेकिन अभी बात करें तो अभी वो स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन में उसम थोड़ा सा टाइम दिख रहा है लक ऑफ इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर लैक ऑफ कनेक्टिविटी जो आप हाईलाइट कर रहे थे लेकिन नोएडा के तो कई माइक्रो मार्केटस है अगेन आपने शुरुआत में ही कहा था क्योंकि यहां पर पब्लिक इंफ्रास्ट्रक्चर पर काम हुआ है पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट पर काम हुआ है तो नोएडा के वो कौन से माइक्रो मार्केट है जहां आप देख रहे हैं और कह सकते हैं लोगों को हा आप आप निवेश कीजिए प्रोबेबली नोएडा आपके लिए एक्सपेंसिव पड़ रहा है तो ये नड के इर्दगिर्द ये माइक्रो मार्केट जो आपको दिख रहा है कि बढ़ रहे हैं यहां पर तो पब्लिक ट्रांसपोर्ट और कनेक्टिविटी बेटर दिख रही है आपने शुरुआत में भी कहा था बिल्कुल देखिए एन 24 को नया नाम भी दे दिया गया और बहुत अच्छा उसे डेवलप भी किया गया उसके पास में लगता हुआ पूरा नोएडा है नोएडा के साथ में क्रॉसिंग रिपब्लिक का एरिया या फिर वैशाली इंदिरापुरम फिर एनएच 58 का एरिया है उसको भी मोहननगर के पास में अच्छी कनेक्टिविटी दी गई है एक बायपास रोड बना के ऑलरेडी एन 58 के उस पार्सल को राजनगर एक्सटेंशन के नाम से जिसे जाना जाता है उसको भी बहुत अच्छा डेवलप किया गया फिर जो आपका लालकुआ जो वाली रोड है हाईवे जो एन 24 उसी के ऊपर आप राइट हैंड साइड में देखेंगे तो आपका नोएडा एक्सटेंशन के नाम से वो भी ग्रेटर नोएडा का पार्ट है वो भी काफी अच्छा खासा डेवलप हुआ है और इवन नोएडा के अंदर ही कई माइक्रो मार्केट डेवलप हुई है जैसे 75 से 79 सेक्टर के बीच में या नोएडा ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे के बीच में पीछे जब जेपी थोड़ा सा कई इशू आए तो वहां कई प्रोजेक्ट रुके लेकिन बाद में वो प्रोजेक्ट अब रिवाइव होने शुरू हो रहे हैं क्योंकि वहां पर सुरक्षा ग्रुप टेकओवर कर रहा है तो ऐसे में वो माइक्रो मार्केट में भी काम हुआ है या सेक्टर 137 की मार्केट देखें तो उन माइक्रो मार्केट में भी काम हुआ है और वहां पर भी पिछले कई सालों में अच्छी एप्रिसिएशन देखने को मिली है और नोएडा से हम थोड़ा सा आगे बढ़ते हैं तो यमुना एक्सप्रेसवे का एरिया ये भी एक अपने आप में प्राइम एरिया है जो जेवर एयरपोर्ट का बेनिफिट जिसे उस एरिया में मिल रहा है और वहां पर भी अच्छी खासी प्रॉपर्टी बाइंग हो रही है ओके सो हम नोयडा का अच्छा खासा एक्सपेंशन देख रहे हैं इसके आसपास हम देख रहे हैं कई माइक्रो मार्केट जो नेशनल हाईवे 24 के इर्दगिर्द कई इलाके हैं एक्सप्रेसवे के इर्दगिर्द के इलाके हैं जो डेवलप हो रहे हैं और व्ट आई अंडरस्टैंड प्रदीप जी यानी कि माइक्रो मार्केट जो नए उभरते हुए इलाके हैं इसमें नोएडा तो बाजी मारते हुए नजर आ रहा है क्योंकि यहां पर अगर आप निवेश करेंगे तो आपको शायद अपसन भी मिलेगा और आपकी शुरुआती निवेश अभी अगर अफोर्डेबल भी आपको प्राइसेस मिल जाएंगे राइट देखिए जब इसकी बात आती है तो चकि यहां एमएनसी और कॉर्पोरेट जो फ 500 कंपनीज है उन्होंने गुरुग्राम को पहले पसंद किया क्योंकि यहां एयरपोर्ट ऑलरेडी डेवलप है जेवर बनेगा एप्रिसिएशन के लिए आप उन एरिया में जा सकते हैं लेकिन किसी भी एरिया को बसने के लिए करीब करीब 20 साल का समय देना पड़ता है यह ट्रेंड है ये शुरू से हम सब देखते आ रहे हैं तो बहुत इमीडिएट में कहूंगा बहुत अच्छा डेवलपमेंट नहीं ओके सर की आवाज जो है वो थोड़ी सी अभी ब्रेक हो गई जी हां आपकी आवाज आ रही है प्रदीप सर लेकिन गुरुग्राम के अंदर ये ऑप्शन मैं कहूंगा कि बहुत लिमिटेड है और यहां स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन जैसे दिख भी रहा है क्योंकि यहां एमएनसी कॉर्पोरेट जो फ्य 500 कंपनीज है जो इंडिया में इन्वेस्ट करना चाहती है इंडिया में काम करना चाहती है उन्होंने गुरुग्राम को बेस बनाया है तो यही रीजन है पर कैपिटा इनकम भी ज्यादा है यहां और लोगों की चॉइस भी वैसी है तो ऐसा नहीं है गुरुग्राम में कहीं कोई कम स्कोप है लेकिन हां जो स्कोप ऑफ एक्सपेंशन है जो एरिया की एरिया के बढ़ने की बात करेंगे तो वो नोएडा के अंदर ज्यादा जरूर नजर आता है ठीक है अब मैं अफॉर्डेबिलिटी पर आऊंगी और सीधा आपसे अगर पूछूंगी कि एक थ्र बीएच के फ्लैट की अपक्स अप्रॉक्स कीमत जो है वो गुड़गांव में कितनी होगी और नोएडा में कितनी होगी देखिए ी बीएचके की अगर हम बात करें तो एप्रोक्सीमेटली अब जो करंट सिनेरियो में रेट आ गए हैं गुरुग्राम के वो करीब करीब 15 से लेकर 00 पर फीट पर आ गए और बी के अगर हम 1800 या 2000 स्क्वा फीट का फ्लैट लेकर चलते हैं तो आप समझ सकते हैं कि यही प्रॉपर्टी करीब करीब तीन सा करोड़ रुप की रेंज में अब आ चुकी है वही अगर हम नोएडा में बात करें तो नोएडा ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे इस टाइम प जो प्रीवेलिंग रेट है वो करीब करीब 12 से 15 हज पर स्क्वा फीट के आसपास आ चुके हैं तो हम अगर उसी को लेकर चले 2000 स्क्वा फीट के प्रॉपर्टी की बात करें तो यह प्रॉपर्टी भी करीब करीब हमें ढाई करोड़ के आसपास की ढाई से ती करोड़ के बीच में पढ़ती है तो नोएडा ग्रेटर नोएडा एक्सप्रेसवे भी उसी तरह से आगे अप्रिशिएट हो रहा है यहां थोड़ा सा मैंने आपको जो कंसर्न बताया पर कैपिटा इनकम का बताया लेकिन स्कोप ऑफ एप्रिसिएशन जिस तरह से रेट नोएडा के थे तो उस तरह से एप्रिसिएशन नड में भी दिख रही है ओके अब ये बताइए रेंटल से कमाई लोग पसंद करते हैं भाई एक निवेश करते हैं जिससे उन्हें रेंटल इनकम हो सके तो किराए से अगर कोई कमाई करना चाहता है तो रेंटल ल्ड के मामले में गुरुग्राम और नोएडा में क्या अंतर है देखिए जब हम रेंटल की बात करते हैं तो रेंटल ओवरऑल 2 पर के आसपास रहता है लेकिन तब भी मैं कहूंगा कि अफोर्डेबल नोएडा के अंदर ज्यादा है क्योंकि यहां प्राइस भी कम है हम उस प्राइस के ऊपर जब दो पर लगाते हैं तो यहां पे अफॉर्डेबिलिटी अपने आप नजर आ जाती है फिर दूसरी बात यहां पे अब तक जो प्रोजेक्ट है उनमें एफआर काफी ज्यादा है मतलब तीन साढ़े की एफआर प करीब करीब यहां प्रोजेक्ट बन रहे हैं तो चकि नंबर अपार्टमेंट ज्यादा होते हैं तो इसीलिए डेवलपर थोड़ा नीचे के रेट प उसे सेल भी कर पाते हैं तो प्रॉपर्टी की वैल्यू उसे कैलकुलेट करेंगे तो रेंटल हमें नोएडा में रीजनेबल मिलेंगे और गुरुग्राम में चकि एफआर 1.75 रेगुलर है अब जो नए प्रोजेक्ट आ रहे हैं वहां गवर्नमेंट ने स्कोप बढ़ाया है जैसे कि जो डेंसिटी थी करीब करीब कंज्यूम हो चुकी थी उसके बाद अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग की जरूरत दिखी तो अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग के लिए पहले 10 और फिर 5 पर एडिशनल मतलब एक सेक्टर के अंदर ग्रुप हाउसिंग जैसे 20 पर होता है तो उसको 10 पर एडिशनल एरिया दिया गया कि अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग बन सके फिर 5 पर एडिशनल एरिया फिर से दिया गया कि अफोर्डेबल हाउसिंग बन सके उसके बाद जो एक्सप्रेसवे जैसी लोकेशन है या मेट्रो जैसी लोकेश है वहां पर टीडी अप्लाई ट्रांजिट ओरिएंटेड डेवलपमेंट होती है वर्क टू होम कल्चर को डेवलप करने के लिए अथॉरिटीज एडिशन एफआर देती है तो वो एडिशनल एफआर टीडी वाला जो पर्पस है वो अब धीरे-धीरे गुरुग्राम में आना शुरू हुआ है तो अब यहां पर भी वो आपको सप्लाई आने वाले टाइम में ज्यादा दिख सकती है जो एक्सप्रेसवे के आसपास की लोकेशन है जैसे कि मैंने बताया डेंसिटी ऑलमोस्ट खत्म हो चुकी थी अब लेकिन चकि टीडी है या एक नया जो अथॉरिटी ने एन आईएल पी न्यू इंटीग्रेटेड लाइसेंसिंग पॉलिसी प वर्क करके एडिशनल स्कोप दिया कि सप्लाई आ सके तो इससे अब सप्लाई और रेंटल अब आने वाले टाइम में हो सकता है थोड़ा सा रीजनेबल हो लेकिन फिलहाल रेंटल में यहां पर भी अच्छी खासी डेवलपमेंट देखने को मिली है मैं कहूंगा कि 2 पर से अब बढ़कर करीब करीब रेंटल यहां 2 पर के आसपास प्रॉपर्टी वैल्यू का दिख रहा है तो अभी एट दिस पॉइंट नोएडा रेंटल ल्ड में आगे है जी ओके न नड रीजनेबल है नइड रीजनेबल है नहीं पर अगर कोई निवेश करता है आने वाले समय में उसे उससे कमाई जब होगी तो उसकी जो रेंटल यील्ड होगी वो बेटर रहेगी रेंटल यील्ड अभी भी हमें गुरुग्राम में ज्यादा बेटर मिले ओके ठीक है अब एक अंतर जो दोनों लोकेशन में है वो है प्रॉपर्टी के टाइप को लेकर के नोएडा और ग्रेटर नोएडा में प्रॉपर्टी लीज होल्ड है और गुरुग्राम में प्रॉपर्टी फ्री होल्ड होती है तो ऐसे में आप घर खरीदारों को किस शहर में प्रॉपर्टी खरीदने की सलाह देते हैं इन दोनों में क्या अंतर होता है यह भी समझा दीजिए देखिए लीज और प्रॉपर्टी मतलब अथॉरिटी की प्रॉपर्टी है अथॉरिटी उसे लॉन्ग टर्म लीस प देती है मतलब एस गुड एस प्रॉपर्टी आप कर रहे कोई बहुत ज्यादा इसमें दिक्कत नजर नहीं आती और उसी प्रकार से गुरुग्राम में फ्री होल्ड प्रॉपर्टी है तो वहां पर किसी टाइप का आपका रेगुलर लीज रेंट नहीं जाता है तो इतना ही डिफरेंस है मतलब दोनों में प्रॉपर्टी की ओनरशिप करीब करीब आपके पास ही है इसमें ऐसी कोई मुझे बहुत ज्यादा डिफरेंस नजर नहीं आता तो इसीलिए घर खरीदार को इसमें बहुत ज्यादा कुछ सोचने की जरूरत नहीं है ठीक है तो लेकिन स्टम ड्यूटी और रजिस्ट्रेशन चार्ज इनम कितना फर्क है दोनों शहरों में करीब करीब बराबर है यहां पर डिफरेंस तब आता है जब प्रॉपर्टी फीमेल के नाम प खरीदी जाती है फीमेल के नाम पर प्रॉपर्टी में करीब करीब 2 पर का रिबेट हरियाणा के अंदर है और यही हम बात करें नोएडा की या यूपी की बात करें तो यहां पर फर्स्ट 10 लाख की प्रॉपर्टी प 10000 का रिबेट है मतलब 1 पर का रिबेट है जो कि टोटल 10000 का रिपेड स्टम ड्यूटी के ऊपर पड़ता है तो बहुत ज्यादा डिफरेंस नोएडा के अंदर फीमेल के नाम पर अगर प्रॉपर्टी खरीदते हैं तो उसके अंदर बहुत ज्यादा डिफरेंस नजर नहीं आता [संगीत] है"

      "string": "Where do we get our dreams from? Our dreams. Do we go after as men what we were denied as children? That which we didn't get as children, do we go after that after growing up? -Hello?\n-Hello, Chauhan? Tell Pandit Ji that I will be\nthere in 15 minutes. Bro, he has enquired twice\nabout where Prashant is. F**k, man. My boss called\nfor a random meeting. -Tell him that I will be there\nin 10 minutes. Thank you. -Bro. Or are we born with our dreams which stay within our hearts? And sometimes, they call out to us. Our dreams tell us to let them live. And in return, they promise us an adventure of a lifetime. A scary but a glorious adventure. Hold up. Look at him, bro. How else? Just look at him. Yo, bro. Bye. -Bye.\n-Bye. Hey, fear isn't completely useless. If it was so, humans wouldn't\nrun after seeing a lion. He would have stood still and\nthen the lion would have eaten him up. But fear saves him by indicating him\nto escape. But, Major sir, where does\nfear come from? And it gets instilled within\nas if settling in a home. Let's pause for a while. -Amazing ride. He was the fun part.\n-Excuse me. No way. -Again?\n-He is the remix, huh? You. And you, there. Why were you pointing fingers at me? -Why were you pointing fingers at me?\n-Bro, chill. You don't have to be so serious\nabout it. They were only having fun. Fun? -Yeah.\n-Yeah. Okay. Look, I am not serious either. I am just asking for\nmy personal feedback. Didn't you like my face? Didn't you like my car? Didn't you like my song? I mean, what can I improve? Actually, I feel all of the above. And since you are standing so close\nto me, please use perfume because\nyou smell just like my driver. -Oh, shit.\n-Oh God. That was brutal, Navya. -Yeah.\n-Yeah. -Thank you.\n-Chill. Bro, where do these kinds of people\ncome from? One second. I wanted to ask\none last thing. Prashant, who gets to play\nthe protagonist in a drama? Someone talented to play the part. He is Samarth. It's his first day\nat Satyanweshi. He has been playing the main characters\nin his English theatre. He is willing to play a small part\nin our act now. Because he wants to experience\nthe stage for a Hindi act. Samarth, why were you chosen\nfor the main roles in those plays? Pandit Ji, it's talent, yes. But I think the most important\nis discipline. I mean discipline and surrender. For one's part and the play as a whole. Talent is a waste if those qualities\nare missing. Pandit Ji, there is nothing more\nimportant to me than this part. -My job is a little unpredictable.\n-Then quit your job. If the role of the main character\nis so important to you, then... Pandit Ji, I have done full-time\ntheatre with you for two years. And now, you know about my compulsion. Prashant, when the play will take place\non the stage, your compulsions won't be seen. What will the audience see? Only your acting and preparation. No. You must have been chosen for the main role in Imtiaz Ali's film. But you didn't do that role. Secondly, I am the Imtiaz Ali here. And I am telling you that you have\nto come on time from tomorrow. You can quit the job\nif that's a hindrance. Or you can quit the main role. Come on. Start reading again. Hey, fear isn't completely useless. If it was so, humans wouldn't\nrun after seeing a lion. He would have stood still. Do you know what this means? Bro, it's F**k you. And I will say it in Hindi for you.\nF**k yourself. Yes! F**k you. And once a F**k you is always a F**k you. No matter what do not take it back.\nIt's sacred. So, if I point a gun at you out of fury, -We are scared.\n-you should still say this. F**k you, Jimmy. Don't take it back. -Yeah.\n-Don't take it back. He won't take it back. -So.\n-F**k, bro. Chill. -Chill, bro.\n-Is it still a F**k you? -I am sorry, bro.\n-Bro, calm down. I say this to you now. F**k you. All right. In your dad's car with the pocket money\ngiven by your mom, you learn a few English songs\nand puke after drinking only two beers, you rich F**ktards, F**k all of you. Sister, the smell that you get\nfrom your driver, your dad must have that too. It's the smell of adrenaline.\nHardworking men smell of that. You roam around with soft boys\nwho wear sweet perfumes and judge me, Ananya Pandey\nfrom North Campus, F**k you. And now, the most important thing. If the father of any of you\nturns out to be a police commissioner or a big politician or a big businessman, if he gets me caught and asks me\nto apologise, I won't apologise. I would still say F**k you. What can I do? A real man can't go back on his words. Calm down, bro.\nWe don't need to do this. All of you bought expensive shoes,\nclothes and cars. Their shopping spree never ends. Yet, all of them are cowards. They couldn't F**king find the courage in any of the malls. Oh shit. But the question remains the same. Where did these dreams come from? You gave us dreams, God.\nNow, what do you want from us? What do I want? Asks God. -Is it true that he was offered a lead\nin Imtiaz Ali's film? -I made dreams When I thought about turning humans\ninto Gods... -That's what we heard.\n-Why didn't he do it then? It's destiny, bro. If someone has a good destiny, he enjoys his life. When someone's destiny is bad,\nhe suffers immensely. He suffered. Wherever dreams come from, whatever reasons they come for, no matter if it's science or divine,\nonce they are planted in our hearts, they become the master and we become\nthe follower. The dream is the master. And we are the servants in the service\nof a dream. And everyone and everything\nthat stands between us is our enemy. And then the dreams vs. everyone. 'School Hall Of Fame' Bro, listen to this. The same case\nwas registered in Noida as well. A broker was giving the key to the\napartment to couples on an hourly basis. He was caught when the boy\ntook the girl to the apartment and he turned out to be the son\nof the owner. The broker was thrashed badly. Bro, don't get inspired by this.\nYour incentive is anyway low. Well, people on a notice period\nare giving lectures now. Get back to work now. 'Pandit Ji - Entry to the rehearsal\nwon't be allowed after 7pm today.' Prashant. Did you join the marketing team? No, sir. Are you still in sales? Okay. -Arpit?\n-Yes, sir. You joined the marketing team, right? -No, sir.\n-No? Hey, Garve. -Marketing team, right? No?\n-No, sir. Okay. Sir, I was making the PPT for\nthe builder client. I am just leaving. F**kers, I am tired of saying this. The sales team shouldn't\nbe in the office after 10am. You should be out\nin the fields, selling. I will fire the one who is still here\nafter three seconds. -What is it? -I wanted to talk\nto you for two minutes. It will be done by the time\nyou finish smoking a cigarette. I will smoke while shitting. Do you want to talk to me? Sir, you can get done with it\nand then... What after that? Go and talk to the client now. You will find me in the office after 6pm\nif you want to talk to me. Sir, I wanted to talk about\nthe evening... -What is it?\n-Sir. -You can smoke. I will tell you what\nI want while standing outside. -What? Brother. Brother. Uncle, I can hear you. Your uncle built a floor in sector 12. He gave me the responsibility\nof selling it. The price of the floor was 1.3 crore\nwhich was 10 lacs more than the market. But that's okay. I thought I would sell it.\nFor three months, I worked very F**king hard. I presented the client with\nmaterial, woodwork, the science of architecture\nand everything else and sold three floors.\nAnd now, we are left with the fourth which is the last floor. The client was going to\ncome in the afternoon today to make the advance payment. Do you know what your uncle\nsaid last night? It's been three months since I didn't\nsell the flat. The price has increased. The rate is 1.4 crore now. Tell me. What should I tell the client?\nTo pay 10 lacs more now? Am I asking for pubic hair? Anyone\ncan just pick them without a care. Oh, wow. I got 20 instead.\nI have extra. Keep it. Who is he, uncle? Him? He is Jatin.\nHe is my brother-in-law's son. He asked me to keep him along\nso that he could learn the job. Can we talk in front of him? Yes. We can. Don't tell anyone in the office\nthat Jimmy met us. Our boss, Kukreja, is Jimmy's uncle. They don't get along well.\nHe is evil like Uncle Kans. Got that? Don't tell anyone about it. Tell me. What do we have to do? Uncle Grover. I am upset with you. Bro, why are you upset with me now? You listed your old Mercedes\nonline to sell it. You didn't tell me about it. I told you about it. Jimmy, it's going to be 15 years old. You wouldn't have been able\nto drive it in NCR anyway. Uncle, I didn't want to drive it. I wanted to make someone jealous. Whom? I have two conditions, uncle.\nIf I get the deal done for you, then you will sell your car to me. And the second one is that\nyou want 50% commission, right? You can keep your commission\nto yourself. -I will take my commission\nfrom the client. -What? You will get your commission\nfrom the client? If you ask the client to pay 10 lacs\nmore, he would spit out scum. And you are saying that you will get\nyour commission from the client. Oh God. -Bro, pack a fresh piece of this.\n-Okay. -And the ones I selected before.\n-Okay, sir. Jatin, do you listen to rap? Yes, a little. Who am I? I am the goon who comes\nduring broad daylight. I steal without a stick or a knife. Selling a house is a farce, bitch.\nI think I have got a cheat code. Rabbit was quite fast.\nSo, you gave him that name. I sell quickly. So, call me Sales God. Let's start training you. Bro, why did buy so many formal clothes? Uncle, I will tell you in the evening\nwhen we party for getting the deal. With my second condition. -Bantu. Listen.\n-Yes, bro. I want furniture for a 3BHK. Within the range of 1.5 to 2 lacs. Listen. Everything should be unique. Nothing similar should be available\nin Delhi, NCR, to compare the rates. Start loading them in the truck.\nI am sending the address. Okay, bro. Our theatre is very reputed, sir. And we have a show in three weeks\nat a very big event. Sir, I have a reading at 7pm every day. So, sir... If there is a meeting in the evening\nat the office, so, I would request you to allow me to leave by 6:30pm max if it's a long meeting. That will be all, sir. I had a boss. Bharat Sai. He was married. Mrs. Sudha. His wife. She was very sweet. Very loyal. Very supportive.\nThe perfect wife. I found out that Sai has a fling outside. Do you understand what a fling is? An affair. He knew that I knew about it. One day, after a few drinks, I asked Sai sir, why does he have another woman? Then Sai said that\nwhenever he meets her, he feels the excitement. Which he doesn't feel in his marriage. Then I asked, Bharat sir, why don't you leave your wife and get married to her? The woman he has a fling with. And then Bharat sir said something. After that, I never had any confusion regarding the choices in life. Sai sir said, Shishir, if you try to turn the fling\ninto a marriage, she will be a bad wife. The thrill of the fling\nwill also be gone. Your passion for acting and job. Which one is your fling?\nAnd which one is your marriage? -Acting...\n-Acting is your fling. Right? If the other woman and your wife\nmake a plan together, apologise to the other woman. Never disappoint... -Your wife.\n-You got it. I have a few concerns\nabout your selling. Let's do this. Finish your meetings and come back to\nthe office. We will talk in the evening. At 7pm. He called you at 7pm at the office. What will you do now? I will go to the theatre. I will tell him that my car\nstopped working. But what was the point of talking\nto him? He now knows that I have a rehearsal\nat 7pm. He would call me to the office\nevery day at 7pm intentionally. But you at least told him what you want. It's essential. To be able to speak and speak up. It's okay. You will learn how\nto convince someone with time. No one cares about what\nsomeone else wants. Be it, your boss or family. -Everything thinks about themselves.\n-Hey, look here. It's getting inside you. The ghost of a dream. Get rid of it. Do it. Jugli jugli jhul jhula. Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. -Jugli jugli jhul jhula.\n-Jugli jugli jus. Greetings, mister. How are you? -Greetings, ma'am. Are you fine?\n-Greetings. Yes. -Wow. Such a nice kid.\n-Say hello to uncle. She has also come along.\nHave you come to see the house as well? Come to uncle. Let me lift you. Very good. I have brought something\nfor you. Shall I give it to you? Here you go. -Chocolate.\n-Wow. Who is this man? Him? He is my cousin. I told him that we have chosen\nthe apartment and we will make the advance payment\ntoday. That's why he also came along to cast\nhis eyes upon it. Cast an eye? Amazing. The relatives\ncome first to cast an eye when something good is going to happen. Cousin, I am just joking. You can cast an eye if you want. Just don't cast an evil eye. Please come, ma'am. Sir, come. Cousin,\ncome on. Let me show you the house. Look at this. The parking is downstairs. Two of your cars can be parked together. They look so excited now. When they find out that\nthe rate has increased by 10 lacs, all the excitement will be gone. Bro, the rate has been increased. We won't tell them that. Then? Let's suppose that you\ntook your father's car out. And got into an accident\nand incurred a loss of 20 thousand. When your dad finds out, he will thrash you badly. What should you tell your dad\nwhen you call him which will make your dad say that it's okay, son? You have come to see the house, right? Looks like someone else\nis also moving in. It seems so. Ma'am, have a look at the fridge\nas well. If you like it, we'll have it\ndelivered for you as well. Yes, we have to get them. -Bro, I would cry first.\n-Okay. And then I will apologise to my dad. Okay. And if I am your dad, I will slap you for hitting the car. And slap you again for crying. You are F**king 22 years old.\nShould you be crying? Tell me what I should say. -The stairs are so nice. Madam.\n-Yes. There is a theatre nearby\nif you want to go for a movie sometime. -Mr. Grover, the furniture is going to\nour flat. -Yes? You should call your dad and tell him that you hit his car. And two people died as a result. One of your hands is not working. The crowd beat you up badly\nand set your car on fire. The relatives of those who died\nare waiting with sticks to beat you up. Just say this.\nPlease save me, dad. Dad? Dad. If you say dad once more, your dad will suffer a cardiac arrest. But you will tell your dad that all this could have happened but didn't happen. You just hit the car\nand there is a loss of 15 thousand. Then your dad will call you a scoundrel. A scoundrel. Is this something to joke about? The car will be repaired. Are you fine? It's called perceptual contrast\nin English. And we say, get someone so scared initially\nthat he can bear anything later. We shouldn't say that the rate\nhas increased by 10 lacs. We have to portray that the flat has been\ndealt to someone else. The advance payment has been made\nby the new owner. The furniture has been placed. They have shifted to the flat already. You can live in the house of your dreams in your dreams. That's enough. It doesn't work\nlike that. Don't worry at all. It's our specialisation. Property deal audit\nwhich means catching fraud and if the property papers are genuine\nor not. The terms and conditions laid by them\nfor the payment. Are they fulfilling their commitment\ngiven to you? We will take care of everything\nfor 3,500 rupees only. Okay. We are going to pay\nthe advance tomorrow. Okay. This is our auditor, Vicky. He will accompany you. He will ensure that you get a fair deal. Is he really an auditor? A CA? Madam, when it comes to property deal fraud, there's no CA or CID to catch them. There's only E.I.D. Experience In Deceitfulness. And I have loads of it. I can sniff it out. Earlier, the owners used to give\nthe house keys to the guard. But some brokers have been\nmisusing vacant flats nowadays. So, now, they give keys\nto someone they trust. When I saw the news that\nsome broker used it for... -That's so shitty.\n-Right. -Greetings, uncle. Prashant from\nProperty Lords. -Greetings. -Hello, sir.\n-Hello. Thank you. The woodwork is already done. In fact, the kitchen has very\nhigh-quality woodwork. And how are the amenities here? Gym, grocery, pharmacy. -The gym is inside the building.\n-Okay. And for basic groceries like bread,\nmilk, and butter, there's a shop inside. For vegetables and pharmacy,\nthere's a market close by. -I see.\n-But most of them home deliver it too. Ishita! Ishita! -Shall I get some water?\n-Ishita. -Ishita, do you have the medicine\nin your bag? -Did she get dizzy? She has a low BP problem. Sir, I need a favour from you. Can you\nrun to the chemist for a medicine? Sure. -It'll take around 15-20 minutes.\n-No problem. She'll be fine till then. -Please get it. I'll send you the name.\n-Okay. Mr. Grover, what is all this? Mr. Atul, just give me two minutes.\nI'm calling Mr. Kukreja. I'm the sole seller of these flats. And\nhe sold the flat without my knowledge. -Give me 2 minutes. I'm talking to him.\n-But... Why are you getting upset? He's trying to sort this out. It took us so long to find\none decent house. Seems like we're not destined to own it. He gave a better offer? All right.\nBut at least you could have told me. I would have spoken to Mr. Atul and\nwe could have matched that offer. Uncle, where is his cousin? What? Is he still up there? Jimmy, that guy is a small-time actor. What if the cousin asks him something? He will screw up everything. And they will get suspicious. Uncle. -Can I have some water?\n-Water? Uncle, I'll go upstairs and check.\nYou handle these people here. Okay, fine. Let me know. Sir, I need a... One second. -Hello.\n-Sir, you haven't sent me the name yet. Yes. I've asked someone back home\nto send me a photo of the medicine. I'll send it to you\nas soon as I get it. Okay? I'm at the medical store.\nLet me know once you have it. Is ma'am all right? I'm waiting for the name. Uncle. How much white and how much cash? 1.37 crore. That's the total amount, uncle.\nHow much white and how much cash? What do you mean by that? I'm paying 1.37. What do you mean by\nhow much white and how much cash? It does, uncle. There's white money\nand then there's cash. That's what I am asking about. I already told you 1.37 in all. Why do you keep asking how much\nwhite and how much cash? Uncle. Caught you. Sorry, Mr. Atul.\nBut the deal is already done. Our offer was for 1.3 crore. And this gentleman sealed it for 1.37. Seven lacs more and\nhe cut a deal directly. And my commission... Mr. Kukreja saved on that too. So, we've lost the house? Actually, Mr. Kukreja was saying that the new owner who has bought this house, he isn't going to live here.\nThis is just for investment purposes. Can we have a word with him\nby any chance? We can surely try. But we'll have to re-negotiate\nthe price. Initially, I thought the owner must\nhave got a better deal. He must have sold it to someone else.\nIt's usual in our line of work. But then I sensed that there is some sham. Looks like you all are a team. Come in, bro. Come. Have a seat. So, where was I? Yes, the sham. Mr. Grover was already\non his way downstairs. So, it's obviously not possible that\nhe mustn't have known which floor the furniture was being\ntaken to. After all, he's the sole seller\nof all the flats here. He would have surely been\na little inquisitive. Right, bro? Then I wondered, why so much drama? Lugging all the furniture up\nand setting up a fake owner. Only to turn down my clients? You could have straight away said\nthat you've cancelled the plan to sell. Why all this drama then? All this drama only to re-negotiate. What do you mean by re-negotiate? 1.37 that he paid plus whatever commission he wants\nover and above that? Yes. I know it's more than what\nwe had decided. But, madam, there's no other way out. We can at least give it a try. Okay. Stop whining. Let me think. -Mr. Grover.\n-Yes. I'd like to discuss this with\nmy cousin once. Your client. You are not his cousin. Look, buddy, if you have a client, then so do we. Doesn't that make us business partners? My dear partner buddy, this epic tale that I've been narrating\nall this while, it certainly wasn't to enthral you. I could have straight away gone and\ntold them about the scam going on here. Fine then. How much? 'Hope you'll be at the theatre\non time today.' 'Yes. I'll be there before 7pm.' Hello. I just got the photo. It's\nMidodrine. Just get one packet. Okay? Okay. By the way, I was wondering how she is. My calculation is quite simple. Cut the mango and share it equally. Half of the total commission. This isn't fair, bro. It was anyway going\nto sell for 1.3 crore. How about this? Anything above 1.3, for whatever price it sells, half of that commission will be yours. Oh, really? Trying to act smart, are you?\nYou will get 2% of 1.3 crore which is 2.6 lacs. Say you sell it for ten lacs more, so half of 2% of 10 lacs\nis what I'll get? Ten thousand? Do I look like a fool to you? Sorry, bro. This is the last offer. Is that so? Who do you think you are? Your sham will be exposed. If I go down and tell them\nabout this shady scheme, your entire deal will go for a toss. And so will your 2.6 lacs commission. My share comes to 1.4 lacs. Only for you, let's\nfinalise it at one lac. No issues, bro. Go and tell them. All right then. Your wish. Let's make it 76,000. Sounds good? -Tell me.\n-Let me make it 10,000 with a dressing table. This one. It came extra\nwith the rest of the stuff. Now, you're taking this too far. -So, did you cast an eye?\n-Listen. Need to speak with you. Hello. Anyone there? Yes, sir. What are you exploring in there\nfor so long with the door locked? Your broker isn't here either. -What the hell are you doing in there?\n-Sir. Sir, please calm down. Mr. Prashant has gone out\nto get medicine. My wife fainted. Her BP dropped. -Fainted? Where is she? Let me see.\n-Sir, she is better now. She's fine. Better now? Hold on. Tell me something, son. Is she better now or\nhas she fainted now? -Sir, she fainted but she's better.\n-What happened? -Why are you here? Sit and relax.\n-No, no. It's okay. What's wrong here? What happened, uncle? Your medicine. Thank you. Thank you. Are you done seeing it?\nSo, are you leaving now or... Is she -going to sit and relax?\n-No, sir. We're done seeing. She'll have her medicine\nand then we'll leave. All right. Make it quick. Give me the keys. I'll turn off\nthe lights and lock the door. Come. Let's go. Take your medicine. -And let's go out and talk.\n-Sure. But, Vinay, you left your stuff inside the room. What? Oh, yes. I'll get it. Is it there where I left it? As I got off the bed, I think I stepped\non it and it went under the bed. I'll just go and get it. I'll take my medicine. I think\nI left the water downstairs. -What is it, son?\n-Nothing, sir. My wife was resting inside. She left\nsomething behind. I'll just get it. Did it go under the bed or what? Yes. But I'll get it out. No worries. Where is it? I will get it, uncle. No worries, uncle. I'll do it. I'll get it out, uncle. You let it be. But where is it? Jimmy, tell me something. He asked you for 1.4 lacs. And you offered him just 10,000\nand a dressing table. Why such a cheap offer? Because the guy seemed intelligent. And hence, I thought he might take the offer. If he was intelligent, why would\nhe take such a bad offer? If he's intelligent, he won't have\nhis eyes on my share. Rather, he will think about how much\nhe would lose if he refused. In English, it's called loss aversion. I call it being a dumbass. Jimmy, I don't get what you're saying. Son, don't try to learn too much\nin one day. Or you'll start choking. The deal is done. I'm happy. Mr. Grover told me about your demand. 1.4 is what we can pay at best. Sure. Please come in. Let's sit and talk. Come. He is one bastard for sure. I spent three months to earn\nmy commission of 2.8 lacs. And this dog swooped away a profit\nof 3.5 lacs in just one day. -The deal's done, sir.\n-Thank you. -Just one request.\n-Yes. -Yes.\n-This furniture that you see, I bought it for this house. And the plan was to sell\na fully furnished flat. Now that you have bought this house,\nthis furniture, -you'll have to buy it too.\n-Of course. Madam was planning anyway. -Isn't that right, madam?\n-Yes. -We do need to buy furniture.\n-No, no. We can't. Sir, we've already overshot the budget. We won't be able to afford it.\nIt's difficult. Atul, at least ask him the price. I bought it for five lacs.\nYou can pay me the same. What? Five lacs? Impossible. At best, we can buy one or two\nessential furniture. Please return the rest. -It should be fine.\n-Return? The person I bought it from\nis standing right here. Let's ask him if it is returnable\nor not. Is it returnable, sir? Sorry. -Not possible.\n-So, you were treating her low BP. You scoundrel. Is this how you were pumping her low BP? Just wait, you son of a... -Hello.\n-Sorry, sir. Sir, I'm calling from\nUltima Prime Society. Sir, we've nabbed that gang. The men who pose as brokers\nand let out rooms to couples. To indulge in indecent acts. Yes, sir. There's this boy named Prashant here. He's the broker. Sir, please come\nright away. Sir, please. Sorry.\nIt won't happen again, sir. Look at him. He is at least apologising. But this guy, he is so sly. He has been standing tight-lipped\nall along. How much do you charge for one time? Must be less than a hotel I'm sure. No wonder couples come to you. Uncle, I've already said this. I came here to show them the flat. And this madam pretended\nto have fainted. I was sent away to the pharmacy. And then they did it. -That's what I've been saying but...\n-Who is that guy? Who is letting out flats? You asshole. Bastard. We have our daughters\nliving here. How dare you dump filth in our society! You F**king bastard! Sir, their query had come directly\ninto our company's system. So, there's no chance our employee\nwas in cahoots with them. Although he shouldn't have left them\nalone in the flat. That was a mistake. They fooled him and he fell for it. What happened? Okay. Let it be. Let's do one thing. Siddharth, Manan, and Samarth, three of you prepare the monologue of\nthe main character in the 12th scene. The new lead actor will now be selected\namongst the three of you. -All right?\n-Yes, Pandit Ji. Come on. Let's proceed. Let's start the rehearsal. We've already\nwasted a lot of time. Let's start. Sir, this girl says that it was\ntheir plan. His company employee is innocent. My wife is calling. I'll be back. -Kaushal, get him out.\n-Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. Bring the girl along. Madam. Here you go. Congratulations\non the Mercedes. It's all yours. Burn all the fuel\nyou want. I'll burn it tomorrow. I'll need kerosene, you see. What rubbish. Hey, Jimmy. If that girl would have lied that you were with them, our company's reputation would have got\nscrewed so badly, you have no idea. Tomorrow morning at 9, there'll be a meeting in the office\nwith the entire team. And in that meeting, I'll make sure\nyou regret this mistake. Good night. And listen. What they were saying that they slapped you\ndue to a misunderstanding, think of it as a tight slap from me. Because in this line of work\nwhere people dupe their clients, you're one of a kind who got duped by the client. It's not their fault. A bastard is only a bigger bastard when an asshole is a bigger asshole. And you are a dumbass, a big one. This is enough for today. I'll sleep well. But why did you do this? Uncle, my car, my wish. -Why are you getting stressed?\n-Fine. Now, here's my second condition. Have you heard of Property Lords? Yes. It's a big name in real estate. -It's your uncle's biggest competitor\ntill date. -Guess what? Hello, Rajkumar. We're glad to\noffer you the role of Sales Manager at our organisation. Please confirm your... -Acceptance of the offer.\n-Of the offer. Regards, Kavita. Some Rajkumar seems to have got a job\nat Property Lords. What am I supposed to do? -Uncle, listen to me carefully.\n-Okay. Rajkumar has got a job\nat Property Lords. Property Lords is your boss's, meaning my uncle, Mr. Kukreja's biggest -competitor.\n-Yes. Many wealthy buyers go to Mr. Kukreja. And Mr. Kukreja, the motherF**ker Kukreja, sells properties to those clients who are also listed with Property lords. All the information about those clients, you need to get it from\nKukreja and give it to Rajkumar. Rajkumar will sell the same property\nto those clients at a cheaper rate and steal the deals from Kukreja. Hold on. Why will I give him\nall the information from there? Because in return, Rajkumar will share his commission with you. Fifty-fifty. Now, -the most important thing.\n-Go on. Uncle, Rajkumar is -Jimmy.\n-Rajkumar is Jimmy. -Rajkumar?\n-That was my name in school. Hey. I'll call you when\nI burn it tomorrow. -I need a smashing video. We'll make\na reel. -Sure, Jimmy. Jimmy, your clothes. You're back. How was your rehearsal? It was good. I hope you told your boss not to keep\nyou at work when you have rehearsals. Yes. It's his father-in-law's company. Why would he care for the rehearsals?\nAll he will care about is work. He just has to request. Tell him frankly. People understand. He will also understand. -Just tell him.\n-I will. How is your health? Absolutely fine. I'll change and come. Some of my fellow soldiers\ngot killed today. Some more may get killed. But before they die, they will think about their dead dreams. Dreams. Where do dreams come from? Okay. So, now, all you children will tell me\nyour name one by one. And what you do aspire to be\nwhen you grow up? Okay. Let's start with this boy who\nis struggling with his shoelace. Prashant, look up.\nSir is talking to you. Prashant. Look up.\nSir is talking to you. -Prashant. Sir is calling you.\n-Quiet, everyone. Looks like Prashant hasn't decided\nwhat he wants to become. But in the next class, we will\nask Prashant again. In fact, before every music class, you all must tell me what you\nwant to be when you grow up. -Sir, every time?\n-Yes, every time. Also, music class will only happen twice\na week, right? But every day, I want all of you to tell someone or the other what you aspire to be when you grow up. Your mother, your father, your siblings or your friends. And if they get irritated hearing it, then tell it to your dog or your cat. They will never get irritated. Sir, what if we don't have a dog or\na cat? Then tell it to your pencil,\nyour eraser, your milk mug, or best of all, to yourself. Standing in front of the mirror. But what's important is to say it\nevery single day. Because if you don't, then by the time you grow up, you might forget what your\naspirations were. And the moment you forget,\nothers will come and tell you what you should be. And you might even believe it. Because what you wished for, you no longer remember it. I, Prashant Narula, will be the best actor of all time.",

      "string": "इन कारणों की वजह से आ सकता है रियल स्टेट इंडस्ट्री में स्लो डाउन या दोस्तों आगे जाकर क्रैश भी आ सकता है हां बिल्कुल ठीक सुना आपने बहुत दिनों से बहुत लोग पूछ रहे थे कमेंट करके कि सर क्या रियल एस्टेट इंडस्ट्री में थोड़ा स्लो डाउन आ सकता है क्या क्रैश आ सकता है अभी तो मार्केट बहुत अच्छा चल रहा है शेयर्स बहुत अच्छे बढ़ रहे हैं पर क्या इन फ्यूचर ऐसा कुछ हो सकता है ऐसा हो सकता है अगर यह कॉमन मिस्टेक्स रिपीट होती रही तो हां दोस्तों यह वीडियो आप सबके लिए इसलिए हमने बनाया है क्योंकि हम चाते हैं कि मार्केट की प्रैक्टिकल आपको पता हो और रियल एस्टेट में काम करने वाला हर एक एंटरप्रेन्योर्स हो लीजिंग एजेंट हो कोई भी काम आप करते हो ये वीडियो को समझना बहुत ज्यादा जरूरी है क्योंकि ये मार्केट के सेंटीमेंट से रिलेटेड है कि मार्केट में एगजैक्टली क्या चल रहा है कहीं-कहीं तो पिक्चर बहुत अच्छी है बहुत कम दिनों में बहुत करोड़ों का सेल होते हुए आपको दिखेगा क्या पर ये पिक्चर हर जगह है क्या हर डेवलपर के साथ ये हो रहा है ये सिर्फ टियर वन सिटी में हो रहा है या टियर टू टियर थ्री टियर फोर में भी हो रहा है ये सब जानना बहुत जरूरी है और ये सब आपको इस वीडियो के एंड तक पता चलने वाला है पॉइंट नंबर फोर और फाइव बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है जो आपको बहुत सारी प्रॉब्लम्स बताएंगे क्योंकि बहुत सारी ऐसे इश्यूज है प्रॉब्लम्स है जो बिल्डर डेवलपर्स को भी आते हैं जिसकी वजह से कभी-कभी वो चाह के भी सही नहीं कर पाते तो ये वीडियो एक विनविन सिचुएशन एंड तक आपको बताएगा कि कौन से प्रॉब्लम्स को अवॉइड करके इस स्लोडाउन को इस क्रैश को थोड़ा कम किया जा सकता है लेकिन कौन से कारण है पहले वो समझ लीजिए और अगर अगर आपको ये वीडियो अच्छा लगता है आप रिस्पांस करते तो हम आगे ये भी सलूशन लेकर आएंगे कि क्या-क्या किया जा सकता है दोस्तों मैं डॉट अमोल मर रिल स्टेट कोच रियल एस्टेट ट्रेनर रियल स्टेड ऑथर एंड एक्सपर्ट अपने पूरे एक्सपीरियंस से जितने भी साल से 16 साल से मैं इस इंडस्ट्री में काम कर रहा हूं जितने भी सीईओ का मैंने इंटरव्यू लिया उन सब को कंबाइन करके कुछ ऐसे प्रैक्टिकल पॉइंट्स हम आपके लिए लेकर आए जो आपको मदद करेंगे कि आने वाले समय में कौन से फैक्टर से स्लो डाउन आ सकता है और आप किन फैक्टर्स पे ध्यान रख के इससे बच सकते हैं पॉइंट नंबर वन जिसकी वजह से स्लो डाउन आ सकता है या क्रैश हो सकता है वो सबसे इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट है हा इन्वेंटरी एंड अ बिग स्लो डाउन दोस्तों हाई इन्वेंटरी एक बहुत बड़ा रीजन है स्लोडाउन के लिए टू मेनी अनसोल्ड हाउसेस ड्यू टू इकोनॉमिक स्लोडाउन ये एक बहुत बड़ा रीजन है बहुत सारे ऐसे हाउसेस है बहुत सारे ऐसे बने बनाए फ्लैट स्कीम्स है जहां पर अभी भी रेडी पोजीशन इन्वेंटरी है और अफॉर्डेबिलिटी कंसर्न है बहुत बड़ा भारत में कई ऐसी सिटीज है जहां नॉर्मल लोगों के रीच से बहुत ज्यादा ऊपर जा चुका है इवन 2 बीएच के 3 बीएच के व बीएच के तक का भी प्राइस लोग चाहकर भी दोस्तों घर नहीं खरीद पा रहे क्योंकि एफर्ट बिलिटी एक बहुत बड़ा एक कंसर्न और प्रॉब्लम हो गया है और इन्वेंटरी बहुत ज्यादा बढ़ती जा रही है क्यों बढ़ती है इन्वेंटरी मैं वो भी लॉजिकली आपको समझाता हूं मान लीजिए पहले जहां पर प्लॉटिंग का प्रोजेक्ट होता था लेआउट का प्रोजेक्ट होता था वहां किसी की चार एकड़ जगह है आजूबाजू एक दो प्रोजेक्ट भी आते हैं लोगों को लगता है यहां फ्लैट की डिमांड बढ़ रही है तो जहां चार एकड़ या पांच एकड़ में 50 55 प्लॉट आने वाले थे सैंक्शन अच्छे क्लियर टाइटल वहां पर टियर टू टियर थ सिटीज में एकदम से टाउनशिप आ जाती है जहां पर 50 फैमिलीज के लिए प्लॉट होने वाले थे वहां 400 घर आ जाते हैं ग्रुप हाउस में सक्शन होकर अब वहां रियली डिमांड है या नहीं है वहां का कन्वर्ज रेशो क्या है वहां पे रिसर्च के हिसाब से कितने घरों की एक्चुअल डिमांड है और ऐसे अगर 1015 प्रोजेक्ट किसी भी टियर टू टियर थ सिटी के ग्रोइंग एरिया में आ गए और 300 400 फ्लैट के 1015 प्रोजेक्ट भी अगर मैं पकड़ता हूं तो 45 हज फ्लैट हो जाते हैं पर क्या 45 हज लोगों की फैमिलीज की उस एरिया में डिमांड है अब बिल्डर डेवलपर को लगता है कि अगर मैं सिर्फ लेआउट करूंगा तो ये 10 करोड़ 15 करोड़ का प्रोजेक्ट होगा अगर मैं कंस्ट्रक्शन करके टाउनशिप बनाऊंगा तो हो सकता है ये 100 करोड़ 150 करोड़ का प्रोजेक्ट हो और जब बड़ा लेआउट होता है मान लीजिए 20-25 एकड़ का वो सोचता है 50 करोड़ का लेआउट करने से अच्छा है 450 करोड़ 500 करोड़ का टाउनशिप प्रोजेक्ट कर ले पर उस केस में इन्वेंटरी बन भी जाती है कभी-कभी कई प्रोजेक्ट तो अटक जाते हैं कि अगर सेल नहीं होता तो स्पीड बहुत स्लो होती है तो वहां पर पोजीशन भी समय पे नहीं मिलता और कुछ प्रोजेक्ट अगर बन भी जाते हैं और बहुत सारी हाई इन्वेंटरी बची हुई है तो उन्हें डिस्काउंट में बेचना पड़ता है दोस्तों यहां तक देखा गया है मार्केट में कि पहले प्रोजेक्ट लच होता है मान लीजिए 5000 स्क्वायर फीट से फिर नहीं बिकता तो बिल्डर कर देते हैं 44700 स्क्वा फीट फिर कर देते हैं 44500 स्क्वा फीट फिर अलग-अलग इवेंट में दो चार 5 लाख के अलग-अलग डिस्काउंट चलाने की कोशिश करते हैं क्योंकि मार्केट में इन्वेंटरी बढ़ते जा रही है और डिमांड कम हो रही है कई जगह पर कई जगह पर डिमांड बहुत ज्यादा है जहां बहुत ज्यादा जॉब्स है जहां बहुत ज्यादा डेवलपमेंट है वहां पर यह प्रॉब्लम कम आती है लेकिन वहां पर भी हर बिल्डर हर डेवलपर का प्रोजेक्ट नहीं बिक रहा है कुछ स्पेसिफिक अच्छा काम करने वाले ब्रांडेड प्लेयर्स का माल कभी-कभी बिक जाता है जिनकी मार्केटिंग बहुत स्ट्रांग है जिनकी टीम बहुत स्ट्रांग है लेकिन जिसके पास सिस्टम नहीं है टीम नहीं है उसका वैसे भी रह जाता है तो यह कुछ कारण है जो आगे जाके बहुत सारी इन्वेंटरी हो जाएगी तो मार्केट स्लो डाउन ना होगा इन्वेस्टर के लिए बायर के लिए अच्छा होगा कि हो सकता है आपको प्रॉपर्टी थोड़ी कम कॉस्ट में मिले 5 पर 10 पर नीचे की कॉस्ट में भी आप बाय कर सकते हो 15 पर भी नीचे लेकिन मार्केट के लिए उतनी अच्छी न्यूज़ नहीं है सेकंड रीजन क्यों स्लो डाउन आ सकता है क्रैश आ सकता है डिमांड सप्लाई का मिट्स मैच ये बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट रीजन है एसिस्टिंग प्रॉपर्टीज बहुत सारी सिटीज में डोंट मैच विद बायर प्रेफरेंसेस लोग बिल्डर स्पेशली छोटे लेवल पे जो काम कर रहे हैं जिनके पास कोई रिसर्च डिपार्टमेंट नहीं है जो कोई बहुत बड़ा लीगल ड्यू टेलिजेंस रिसर्च नहीं करते कोई प्लानिंग स्ट्रेटेजी नहीं बनाते प्रोजेक्ट लच करने से पहले वहां क्या हो जाता है मार्केट में जो रिक्वायरमेंट है क्लाइंट का उससे 20 पर 25 पर ऊपर प्रोडक्ट लॉच कर देते हैं साइजेस अच्छे देते हैं प्रोडक्ट अच्छा प्लान करते हैं पर वहां मार्केट में लोगों का जो डिमांड होगा जो वहां के कस्टमर का बाइंग कैपेसिटी होगा दोस्तों मैं कॉन्फिडेंस से इसलिए कह पा रहा हूं इसी टॉपिक पर हमने मैंने एक पीएचडी की है कंज्यूमर बाइंग बिहेवियर इन रियल स्टेट 2000 रियल स्टेट के कस्टमर 200 एंप और 50 सीईओ से बात करने के बाद 250 पेज का थिसिस लिखकर कि कंज्यूमर का एक्सपेक्टेशन क्या होता है किस एरिया में वो क्या देखकर प्रॉपर्टी खरीदता है उसका डिसीजन किन चीजों से एंपावर होता है इन सब चीजों को जब कोई बिल्डर उसकी टीम समझती है और प्रोडक्ट उसको मैच करता हुआ आता है किसी-किसी एरिया में अचानक से तीन-चार महीने में 200 फ्लैट बिक जाते हैं उसी एरिया में किसी और बिल्डर का प्रोडक्ट दो साल से नहीं बिक रहा होता है हो सकता है जिसका दो महीने तीन महीने में बिक गया उसने मार्केट में पूरे प्रोडक्ट को समझकर अपना प्रोडक्ट लाया सबका प्रोडक्ट हो सकता है 1100 से 1200 स्क्वा फीट का 2 बीएच के था इसका प्रोडक्ट 950 से 1000 ही है लेकिन साइजेस बहुत अच्छे है लोडिंग कम है और और सही साइज लोगों को सही रेट में मिल रहा है इसलिए फटाफट इसके फ्लैट बिक रहे बाकी फ्लैट नहीं बिक रहे तो लोगों के एक्सपेक्टेशन से मैच भी तो होना चाहिए हो सकता है लोगों को मास्टर बेडरूम और हॉल दोनों में बालकनी चाहिए लेकिन बहुत सारे प्रोजेक्ट में वो नहीं मिली तो इस वजह से लोग नहीं ले रहे लोगों के एक्स रीजंस होते हैं नहीं खरीदने के स्लो डाउन तब आएगा क्रैश तब आ सकता है जब बहुत सारा प्रोडक्ट बन जाए और बिके ना और फिर बड़े-बड़े टावर खाली पड़े हो ऐसा भी पॉसिबल है दोस्तों क्योंकि जब ऐसा कहा जाता है मार्केट में जब समय सही चल रहा होता है फ्लो अच्छा होता है मार्केट में एक लहर होती है तो आपका प्रोडक्ट बिक जाता है लेकिन अगर वो रुक गया तो उसके बाद अच्छा इन्वेंटरी भी बचा रह जाता है तो डिमांड सप्लाई का बहुत बड़ा मिसमैच है क्यों क्योंकि लोगों के एक्सपेक्टेशन से प्रोडक्ट्स मैच नहीं कर रहे कभी-कभी बिल्डर डेवलपर किसी ऐसे एरिया में इतनी एमेनिटीज दे देते हैं इतनी ज्यादा अच्छा लग्जरियस प्रोजेक्ट लच करते हैं कि आजूबाजू का मार्केट से वो एकदम डबल ट्रिपल कॉस्ट में चला जाता है तो फिर वहां लोगों का मिसमैच हो जाता है कि लोग सोचते हैं जब इतना ही पैसा देना है तो फिर मैं प्रीमियम एरिया में थोड़ा छोटा ही घर सेही क्यों ना ले लू हो सकता है वो प्रीमियम फ्लैट 2000 स् फीट का 3 बीएच के हो और इसको 1500 फुट का प्रीमियम एरिया में उस रेट में मिले लेकिन वो सोचता है कि अगर एरिया बहुत अच्छा है तो 1500 फुट का फ्लैट से कोई दिक्कत नहीं है फिर वहां पे भी इन्वेंटरी बच जाती है तो ऐसे बहुत सारे कारण है जिसके वजह से मार्केट में आगे जाके स्लो डाउन आ सकता है अगर आज इस पे सोल्यूशन नहीं निकाला गया बिल्डर डेवलपर्स ने सोच समझकर प्रोजेक्ट लांच नहीं किए मार्केट के एक्सपेक्टेशन को समझ के प्रॉपर रिसर्च को देखकर लॉन्च नहीं किया तो दोस्तों बहुत आगे प्रॉब्लम आ सकता है तीसरा कारण गेटिंग लोन इज टफ हां दोस्तों आप कहेंगे सर इतना तो लोन अवेलेबल है इतने बैंक लोन देने के लिए अवेलेबल है कितना लोगों को को फटाफट लोन मिल रहा है लेकिन दोस्तों लोन के बारे में अगर मैं कहूं तो थोड़े स्ट्रिक्ट लैंडिंग नॉर्म्स आ रहे हैं इतने इजली किसी को भी लोन नहीं अवेलेबल हो र और अगर हो भी रहा है तो हाई कंस्ट्रक्शन कॉस्ट की वजह से थोड़ा प्रोजेक्ट फाइनेंसिंग में भी डिस्टरबेंस आ जाते हैं दूसरा लोगों को लोन कराते समय जो अब रेट ऑफ इंटरेस्ट मिल रहा है बीच में अगर आप देखेंगे तो जो होम लोन का इंटरेस्ट है वो 65 7 पर तक चला गया था आराम से 6.75 7 पर तक होम लोन मिल जाता था लेकिन अब होम लोन का इंटरेस्ट बढ़ता जा रहा है 8.5 % बहुत नॉर्मल हो गया है थोड़ा सा भी आपका सिबल ठीक नहीं हो 8.7 9 9.5 तक आपका होम लोन जाता है उस केस में आपका ईएमआई बढ़ जाता है उस केस में आपको बहुत इंटरेस्ट पे करना पड़ता है तो लोगों के लिए अब होम लोन की अफॉर्डेबिलिटी थोड़ी डिफिकल्ट होती जा रही है उस केस में भी लोगों का बाइंग पावर जो है वो थोड़ा कम होता जा रहा है और अगर मटेरियल ज्यादा बनता जाएगा इन्वेंटरी बहुत बनेगी और बाइंग पावर कम होता जाएगा तो भी मार्केट में गैप आएगा स्लो डाउन आने के चांसेस है तो मार्केट में करेक्शन आ सकता है अगर ये चीजें कंटिन्यू रही तो चौथा बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट लेकिन पॉइंट नंबर फोर जानने से पहले दोस्तों मैं कहूंगा आपको कि अगर आपने चैनल को सब्सक्राइब नहीं किया तो तुरंत सब्सक्राइब करके बेल आइकॉन को हिट करो हम नहीं चाहते ऐसे इंपॉर्टेंट वैल्यू एडेड रियल एस्टेट के वीडियोस कभी आपके मिस हो पॉइंट नंबर फोर गेटिंग परमिट टेक्स मोर टाइम बहुत इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट है बिल्डर एंड डेवलपर्स के पॉइंट ऑफ़ व्यू से बता रहा हूं कॉम्प्लेक्शन है जो अप्रूवल को डिले करते हैं जिसकी वजह से कॉस्टिंग बढ़ती है कभी-कभी क्या होता है बिल्डर बहुत बड़ा प्रोजेक्ट लॉच कर देता है उसके पहले के उसके जितने प्रोजेक्ट थे वहां हो सकता है उतनी एनओसी की जरूरत नहीं थी मान लीजिए 200 फ्लैट में आपको एनवायरमेंट की एनओसी नहीं लगी लेकिन 500 फ्लैट में आपको एनवायरमेंट की एनओसी लग रही एनवायरमेंट की एनओसी इतनी जल्दी नहीं मिल जाती थोड़ा समय लगता है जिसके वजह से प्रोजेक्ट का लॉन्च डिले हो जाता है दूसरा कॉम्प्लेक्शन होने की वजह से क्योंकि बिल्डर के पास उतना एजुकेटेड उतना स्किलफुल उतना टैलेंटेड स्टाफ नहीं होता तो वो सैंक्शनिंग का प्रोसेस डिले होने की वजह से प्रोजेक्ट कॉस्ट में भी फर्क पड़ता है दूसरा उस दौरान अगर किसी बहुत स्मार्ट बिल्डर को वहां पर जल्दी स्मार्ट कहिए या जिसकी बहुत अच्छी पहचान हो गई है जिसके पास पावर हो गई है अगर उसे जल्दी परमिशन मिल गया उसका इन्वेंटरी जल्दी लॉन्च हो जाता है जल्दी-जल्दी बिक जाता है तो जो मार्केट की डिमांड थी मान लीजिए 100 फ्लैट 200 फ्लैट 300 फ्लैट की वो खत्म हो गई और आपका प्रोजेक्ट लच होते होते छ महीना डिले हो गया एक साल डिले हो गया वहां पर जो डिमांड था वो कंज्यूम कर लिया उस बिल्डर ने जिसको जल्दी सैंक्शनिंग मिल गई दूसरा बहुत ज्यादा टीम स्किलफुल या टेक्नोलॉजी में वस ना होने की वजह से ऑनलाइन सैंक्शनिंग ऑनलाइन प्रोसेसेस लोग जल्दी नहीं कर पाते चाहे सैंक्शनिंग का प्रोसेस हो दोस्तों चाहे रीरा का प्रोसेस हो बहुत सारी चीजों में लोग डिले हो जाते हैं जिसकी वजह से भी फिर उनका इन्वेंटरी रह जाता है स्लो डाउन और क्रैश आने के चांसेस बढ़ जाते हैं तो ये बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट रीजन है हो सके तो अपने आप को अपग्रेड जल्दी कीजिए अपनी टीम को अपग्रेड कीजिए जितनी जल्दी आप इन चीजों को समझेंगे और जितनी जल्दी गवर्नमेंट भी इन प्रोसेस को और इजी कर पाएगी मुझे लगता है ये स्लो डाउन और कैश के चांसेस कम हो जाएंगे वट नंबर फाइव नॉट यूजिंग लेटेस्ट टेक्नोलॉजी ये बहुत-बहुत बड़ा इशू है ऐसा नहीं है कि मार्केट में अपग्रेडेशन नहीं है मार्केट में प्रॉपर प्रॉप टेक कंपनीज नहीं है सॉफ्टवेयर कंपनीज नहीं है सीआरएम नहीं है ईआरपी नहीं है सब कुछ है लेकिन थोड़ा सा टेक्नोलॉजी का जो अपग्रेडेशन कहिए या टेक्नोलॉजी को एक्सेप्ट करना वो फैक्टर कम होने की वजह से इन सब चीजों का यूज करके जल्दी चीजें नहीं हो पा रही है प्रॉमिस तो कर देते हैं दो साल में कंप्लीट हो हो जाएगा 3 साल में क इनके पास कोई ऐसा एफिशिएंसी नहीं होती ऐसे कोई ऑपरेशंस नहीं होते जिसके वजह से समय पे प्रोजेक्ट कंप्लीट हो जाए बड़े से बड़े बिल्डर भी डिले हो रहे हैं 1 साल 2 साल 3 साल पांच पांच साल प्रोजेक्ट कहीं-कहीं डिले हो रहे हैं जिसकी वजह से अगेन लोगों ने खरीद तो लिया समय पे प्रोजेक्ट मिला नहीं ईएमआई शुरू हो गई ऐसे बहुत सारी प्रॉब्लम्स लोगों को होते हैं तो ये कुछ ऐसे कारण है जिसके वजह से आने वाले समय में और स्लो डाउन आ सकता है इसके बहुत सारे सोलूशंस है बहुत इजी सॉल्यूशंस है अगर आप सॉल्यूशन बहुत सारे जानना चाहते हैं तो नीचे कमेंट कीजिए सलूशन या अगर 200 से ज्यादा लोगों ने इस वीडियो को लाइक किया शेयर किया तो हम पूरे सलूशन लेकर आएंगे कि कैसे इस स्लोडाउन को इस क्रैश को बचाया जा सकता है कम किया जा सकता है ये सब रिसर्च बेस्ड चीज है क्योंकि 100 से ज्यादा रियल स्टेट सीईओ से हर कोने-कोने में देश के हर सिटी हर स्टेट में बात करने के बाद हमें इतना तो जरूर पता है कि किन चीजों से किन चीजों पे कंट्रोल किया जा सकता है और 4 साल लगे उस बुक को पूरी तरह से लिखने में रियल स्टेट गेम चेंजर को जिसको आपने रियल स्टेट गेम चेंजर को एक नेशनल बेस्टसेलर बुक बनाया वो पूरी रिसर्च से हम ये जरूर बता सकते हैं कि कैसे आने वाले समय में इस स्लोडाउन को कम किया जा सकता है या इस क्रैश से बचा जा सकता है जो मैं पक्का नेक्स्ट वीडियो में लेकर आऊंगा आप सबके लिए अगर आपने इस वीडियो को ज्यादा से ज्यादा शेयर किया ज्यादा से ज्यादा कमेंट आए टाइप कीजिए सॉल्यूशन किसी और टॉपिक पर वीडियो देखना चाहते हैं नीचे कमेंट करके बताइए कौन से टॉपिक पर आप चाहते हैं हमारी टीम को वीडियो बनाए वीडियो को लाइक करना ना भूले दोस्तों आपके लाइक से मुझे और मेरी टीम को बहुत एनर्जी बहुत सपोर्ट मिलता है कि ऐसा वैल्यू एडेड कंटेंट देश में लेकर आए क्योंकि य स्ट के हर एंटरप्रेन्योर सकते हैं आने वाले समय में क्या प्रॉब्लम आ सकती है सिर्फ दो चार 10 प्लेयर्स के अच्छा करने से पूरी इंडस्ट्री में सब लोग अच्छा कर रहे हैं ऐसा नहीं है टियर टू टियर थ्री सिटी में ये प्रॉब्लम बहुत ज्यादा है टियर वन सिटीज के भी सबब एरियाज में जो डेवलपिंग एरियाज है वहां पर ये इश्यूज होते हैं लोग कैलकुलेट नहीं कर पाते कि रियल डिमांड वहां पर क्या है और प्रोजेक्ट तो लांच कर देते हो और उसके बाद प्रॉब्लम्स आना शुरू होती है 6 महीने एक साल दो साल तीन साल बाद तो अगर आपका प्रोजेक्ट मिसमैच हो रहा है अगर आपका प्रोडक्ट मैच नहीं हो रहा है अगर आप प्रॉपर रिसर्च के बिना प्रोजेक्ट लाच कर रहे है तो चांसेस है कि आपका लाखों करोड़ों रुपए लग तो जाएगा लेकिन प्रोजेक्ट उतना सफल नहीं होगा इन सब चीजों से अगर आप बच ना चाहते हैं आपको लगता है कोई एक्सपर्ट ओपिनियन की भी आपको जरूरत है आप हमारे बोर्डलाइन नंबर पे कांटेक्ट कर सकते हैं या डिस्क्रिप्शन में एक फॉर्म दिया है आरजीसी सीईओ कोचिंग का एज अ डायरेक्टर बिल्डर डेवलपर आप वो फॉर्म फिल कर सकते हैं अगर हमारी टीम आपको सेलेक्ट करती है तो मेरे साथ वन टू वन क्लेरिटी कॉल आप कर सकते हैं स्ट्रेटेजी कॉल कर सकते हैं जिसमें हम कोशिश करेंगे आपके प्रोजेक्ट को जल्दी सक्सेसफुल बनाने की और ऐसे स्लोडाउन में कहीं आपका प्रोजेक्ट ना अटक जाए इसके लिए आपको सही गाइडेंस और एक्सपर्ट ओपिनियन देने की थैंक यू सो मच फॉर योर लव थैंक यू सो मच फॉर योर

      "इन कारणों की वजह से आ सकता है रियल स्टेट इंडस्ट्री में स्लो डाउन या दोस्तों आगे जाकर क्रैश भी आ सकता है हां बिल्कुल ठीक सुना आपने बहुत दिनों से बहुत लोग पूछ रहे थे कमेंट करके कि सर क्या रियल एस्टेट इंडस्ट्री में थोड़ा स्लो डाउन आ सकता है क्या क्रैश आ सकता है अभी तो मार्केट बहुत अच्छा चल रहा है शेयर्स बहुत अच्छे बढ़ रहे हैं पर क्या इन फ्यूचर ऐसा कुछ हो सकता है ऐसा हो सकता है अगर यह कॉमन मिस्टेक्स रिपीट होती रही तो हां दोस्तों यह वीडियो आप सबके लिए इसलिए हमने बनाया है क्योंकि हम चाते हैं कि मार्केट की प्रैक्टिकल आपको पता हो और रियल एस्टेट में काम करने वाला हर एक एंटरप्रेन्योर्स हो लीजिंग एजेंट हो कोई भी काम आप करते हो ये वीडियो को समझना बहुत ज्यादा जरूरी है क्योंकि ये मार्केट के सेंटीमेंट से रिलेटेड है कि मार्केट में एगजैक्टली क्या चल रहा है कहीं-कहीं तो पिक्चर बहुत अच्छी है बहुत कम दिनों में बहुत करोड़ों का सेल होते हुए आपको दिखेगा क्या पर ये पिक्चर हर जगह है क्या हर डेवलपर के साथ ये हो रहा है ये सिर्फ टियर वन सिटी में हो रहा है या टियर टू टियर थ्री टियर फोर में भी हो रहा है ये सब जानना बहुत जरूरी है और ये सब आपको इस वीडियो के एंड तक पता चलने वाला है पॉइंट नंबर फोर और फाइव बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है जो आपको बहुत सारी प्रॉब्लम्स बताएंगे क्योंकि बहुत सारी ऐसे इश्यूज है प्रॉब्लम्स है जो बिल्डर डेवलपर्स को भी आते हैं जिसकी वजह से कभी-कभी वो चाह के भी सही नहीं कर पाते तो ये वीडियो एक विनविन सिचुएशन एंड तक आपको बताएगा कि कौन से प्रॉब्लम्स को अवॉइड करके इस स्लोडाउन को इस क्रैश को थोड़ा कम किया जा सकता है लेकिन कौन से कारण है पहले वो समझ लीजिए और अगर अगर आपको ये वीडियो अच्छा लगता है आप रिस्पांस करते तो हम आगे ये भी सलूशन लेकर आएंगे कि क्या-क्या किया जा सकता है दोस्तों मैं डॉट अमोल मर रिल स्टेट कोच रियल एस्टेट ट्रेनर रियल स्टेड ऑथर एंड एक्सपर्ट अपने पूरे एक्सपीरियंस से जितने भी साल से 16 साल से मैं इस इंडस्ट्री में काम कर रहा हूं जितने भी सीईओ का मैंने इंटरव्यू लिया उन सब को कंबाइन करके कुछ ऐसे प्रैक्टिकल पॉइंट्स हम आपके लिए लेकर आए जो आपको मदद करेंगे कि आने वाले समय में कौन से फैक्टर से स्लो डाउन आ सकता है और आप किन फैक्टर्स पे ध्यान रख के इससे बच सकते हैं पॉइंट नंबर वन जिसकी वजह से स्लो डाउन आ सकता है या क्रैश हो सकता है वो सबसे इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट है हा इन्वेंटरी एंड अ बिग स्लो डाउन दोस्तों हाई इन्वेंटरी एक बहुत बड़ा रीजन है स्लोडाउन के लिए टू मेनी अनसोल्ड हाउसेस ड्यू टू इकोनॉमिक स्लोडाउन ये एक बहुत बड़ा रीजन है बहुत सारे ऐसे हाउसेस है बहुत सारे ऐसे बने बनाए फ्लैट स्कीम्स है जहां पर अभी भी रेडी पोजीशन इन्वेंटरी है और अफॉर्डेबिलिटी कंसर्न है बहुत बड़ा भारत में कई ऐसी सिटीज है जहां नॉर्मल लोगों के रीच से बहुत ज्यादा ऊपर जा चुका है इवन 2 बीएच के 3 बीएच के व बीएच के तक का भी प्राइस लोग चाहकर भी दोस्तों घर नहीं खरीद पा रहे क्योंकि एफर्ट बिलिटी एक बहुत बड़ा एक कंसर्न और प्रॉब्लम हो गया है और इन्वेंटरी बहुत ज्यादा बढ़ती जा रही है क्यों बढ़ती है इन्वेंटरी मैं वो भी लॉजिकली आपको समझाता हूं मान लीजिए पहले जहां पर प्लॉटिंग का प्रोजेक्ट होता था लेआउट का प्रोजेक्ट होता था वहां किसी की चार एकड़ जगह है आजूबाजू एक दो प्रोजेक्ट भी आते हैं लोगों को लगता है यहां फ्लैट की डिमांड बढ़ रही है तो जहां चार एकड़ या पांच एकड़ में 50 55 प्लॉट आने वाले थे सैंक्शन अच्छे क्लियर टाइटल वहां पर टियर टू टियर थ सिटीज में एकदम से टाउनशिप आ जाती है जहां पर 50 फैमिलीज के लिए प्लॉट होने वाले थे वहां 400 घर आ जाते हैं ग्रुप हाउस में सक्शन होकर अब वहां रियली डिमांड है या नहीं है वहां का कन्वर्ज रेशो क्या है वहां पे रिसर्च के हिसाब से कितने घरों की एक्चुअल डिमांड है और ऐसे अगर 1015 प्रोजेक्ट किसी भी टियर टू टियर थ सिटी के ग्रोइंग एरिया में आ गए और 300 400 फ्लैट के 1015 प्रोजेक्ट भी अगर मैं पकड़ता हूं तो 45 हज फ्लैट हो जाते हैं पर क्या 45 हज लोगों की फैमिलीज की उस एरिया में डिमांड है अब बिल्डर डेवलपर को लगता है कि अगर मैं सिर्फ लेआउट करूंगा तो ये 10 करोड़ 15 करोड़ का प्रोजेक्ट होगा अगर मैं कंस्ट्रक्शन करके टाउनशिप बनाऊंगा तो हो सकता है ये 100 करोड़ 150 करोड़ का प्रोजेक्ट हो और जब बड़ा लेआउट होता है मान लीजिए 20-25 एकड़ का वो सोचता है 50 करोड़ का लेआउट करने से अच्छा है 450 करोड़ 500 करोड़ का टाउनशिप प्रोजेक्ट कर ले पर उस केस में इन्वेंटरी बन भी जाती है कभी-कभी कई प्रोजेक्ट तो अटक जाते हैं कि अगर सेल नहीं होता तो स्पीड बहुत स्लो होती है तो वहां पर पोजीशन भी समय पे नहीं मिलता और कुछ प्रोजेक्ट अगर बन भी जाते हैं और बहुत सारी हाई इन्वेंटरी बची हुई है तो उन्हें डिस्काउंट में बेचना पड़ता है दोस्तों यहां तक देखा गया है मार्केट में कि पहले प्रोजेक्ट लच होता है मान लीजिए 5000 स्क्वायर फीट से फिर नहीं बिकता तो बिल्डर कर देते हैं 44700 स्क्वा फीट फिर कर देते हैं 44500 स्क्वा फीट फिर अलग-अलग इवेंट में दो चार 5 लाख के अलग-अलग डिस्काउंट चलाने की कोशिश करते हैं क्योंकि मार्केट में इन्वेंटरी बढ़ते जा रही है और डिमांड कम हो रही है कई जगह पर कई जगह पर डिमांड बहुत ज्यादा है जहां बहुत ज्यादा जॉब्स है जहां बहुत ज्यादा डेवलपमेंट है वहां पर यह प्रॉब्लम कम आती है लेकिन वहां पर भी हर बिल्डर हर डेवलपर का प्रोजेक्ट नहीं बिक रहा है कुछ स्पेसिफिक अच्छा काम करने वाले ब्रांडेड प्लेयर्स का माल कभी-कभी बिक जाता है जिनकी मार्केटिंग बहुत स्ट्रांग है जिनकी टीम बहुत स्ट्रांग है लेकिन जिसके पास सिस्टम नहीं है टीम नहीं है उसका वैसे भी रह जाता है तो यह कुछ कारण है जो आगे जाके बहुत सारी इन्वेंटरी हो जाएगी तो मार्केट स्लो डाउन ना होगा इन्वेस्टर के लिए बायर के लिए अच्छा होगा कि हो सकता है आपको प्रॉपर्टी थोड़ी कम कॉस्ट में मिले 5 पर 10 पर नीचे की कॉस्ट में भी आप बाय कर सकते हो 15 पर भी नीचे लेकिन मार्केट के लिए उतनी अच्छी न्यूज़ नहीं है सेकंड रीजन क्यों स्लो डाउन आ सकता है क्रैश आ सकता है डिमांड सप्लाई का मिट्स मैच ये बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट रीजन है एसिस्टिंग प्रॉपर्टीज बहुत सारी सिटीज में डोंट मैच विद बायर प्रेफरेंसेस लोग बिल्डर स्पेशली छोटे लेवल पे जो काम कर रहे हैं जिनके पास कोई रिसर्च डिपार्टमेंट नहीं है जो कोई बहुत बड़ा लीगल ड्यू टेलिजेंस रिसर्च नहीं करते कोई प्लानिंग स्ट्रेटेजी नहीं बनाते प्रोजेक्ट लच करने से पहले वहां क्या हो जाता है मार्केट में जो रिक्वायरमेंट है क्लाइंट का उससे 20 पर 25 पर ऊपर प्रोडक्ट लॉच कर देते हैं साइजेस अच्छे देते हैं प्रोडक्ट अच्छा प्लान करते हैं पर वहां मार्केट में लोगों का जो डिमांड होगा जो वहां के कस्टमर का बाइंग कैपेसिटी होगा दोस्तों मैं कॉन्फिडेंस से इसलिए कह पा रहा हूं इसी टॉपिक पर हमने मैंने एक पीएचडी की है कंज्यूमर बाइंग बिहेवियर इन रियल स्टेट 2000 रियल स्टेट के कस्टमर 200 एंप और 50 सीईओ से बात करने के बाद 250 पेज का थिसिस लिखकर कि कंज्यूमर का एक्सपेक्टेशन क्या होता है किस एरिया में वो क्या देखकर प्रॉपर्टी खरीदता है उसका डिसीजन किन चीजों से एंपावर होता है इन सब चीजों को जब कोई बिल्डर उसकी टीम समझती है और प्रोडक्ट उसको मैच करता हुआ आता है किसी-किसी एरिया में अचानक से तीन-चार महीने में 200 फ्लैट बिक जाते हैं उसी एरिया में किसी और बिल्डर का प्रोडक्ट दो साल से नहीं बिक रहा होता है हो सकता है जिसका दो महीने तीन महीने में बिक गया उसने मार्केट में पूरे प्रोडक्ट को समझकर अपना प्रोडक्ट लाया सबका प्रोडक्ट हो सकता है 1100 से 1200 स्क्वा फीट का 2 बीएच के था इसका प्रोडक्ट 950 से 1000 ही है लेकिन साइजेस बहुत अच्छे है लोडिंग कम है और और सही साइज लोगों को सही रेट में मिल रहा है इसलिए फटाफट इसके फ्लैट बिक रहे बाकी फ्लैट नहीं बिक रहे तो लोगों के एक्सपेक्टेशन से मैच भी तो होना चाहिए हो सकता है लोगों को मास्टर बेडरूम और हॉल दोनों में बालकनी चाहिए लेकिन बहुत सारे प्रोजेक्ट में वो नहीं मिली तो इस वजह से लोग नहीं ले रहे लोगों के एक्स रीजंस होते हैं नहीं खरीदने के स्लो डाउन तब आएगा क्रैश तब आ सकता है जब बहुत सारा प्रोडक्ट बन जाए और बिके ना और फिर बड़े-बड़े टावर खाली पड़े हो ऐसा भी पॉसिबल है दोस्तों क्योंकि जब ऐसा कहा जाता है मार्केट में जब समय सही चल रहा होता है फ्लो अच्छा होता है मार्केट में एक लहर होती है तो आपका प्रोडक्ट बिक जाता है लेकिन अगर वो रुक गया तो उसके बाद अच्छा इन्वेंटरी भी बचा रह जाता है तो डिमांड सप्लाई का बहुत बड़ा मिसमैच है क्यों क्योंकि लोगों के एक्सपेक्टेशन से प्रोडक्ट्स मैच नहीं कर रहे कभी-कभी बिल्डर डेवलपर किसी ऐसे एरिया में इतनी एमेनिटीज दे देते हैं इतनी ज्यादा अच्छा लग्जरियस प्रोजेक्ट लच करते हैं कि आजूबाजू का मार्केट से वो एकदम डबल ट्रिपल कॉस्ट में चला जाता है तो फिर वहां लोगों का मिसमैच हो जाता है कि लोग सोचते हैं जब इतना ही पैसा देना है तो फिर मैं प्रीमियम एरिया में थोड़ा छोटा ही घर सेही क्यों ना ले लू हो सकता है वो प्रीमियम फ्लैट 2000 स् फीट का 3 बीएच के हो और इसको 1500 फुट का प्रीमियम एरिया में उस रेट में मिले लेकिन वो सोचता है कि अगर एरिया बहुत अच्छा है तो 1500 फुट का फ्लैट से कोई दिक्कत नहीं है फिर वहां पे भी इन्वेंटरी बच जाती है तो ऐसे बहुत सारे कारण है जिसके वजह से मार्केट में आगे जाके स्लो डाउन आ सकता है अगर आज इस पे सोल्यूशन नहीं निकाला गया बिल्डर डेवलपर्स ने सोच समझकर प्रोजेक्ट लांच नहीं किए मार्केट के एक्सपेक्टेशन को समझ के प्रॉपर रिसर्च को देखकर लॉन्च नहीं किया तो दोस्तों बहुत आगे प्रॉब्लम आ सकता है तीसरा कारण गेटिंग लोन इज टफ हां दोस्तों आप कहेंगे सर इतना तो लोन अवेलेबल है इतने बैंक लोन देने के लिए अवेलेबल है कितना लोगों को को फटाफट लोन मिल रहा है लेकिन दोस्तों लोन के बारे में अगर मैं कहूं तो थोड़े स्ट्रिक्ट लैंडिंग नॉर्म्स आ रहे हैं इतने इजली किसी को भी लोन नहीं अवेलेबल हो र और अगर हो भी रहा है तो हाई कंस्ट्रक्शन कॉस्ट की वजह से थोड़ा प्रोजेक्ट फाइनेंसिंग में भी डिस्टरबेंस आ जाते हैं दूसरा लोगों को लोन कराते समय जो अब रेट ऑफ इंटरेस्ट मिल रहा है बीच में अगर आप देखेंगे तो जो होम लोन का इंटरेस्ट है वो 65 7 पर तक चला गया था आराम से 6.75 7 पर तक होम लोन मिल जाता था लेकिन अब होम लोन का इंटरेस्ट बढ़ता जा रहा है 8.5 % बहुत नॉर्मल हो गया है थोड़ा सा भी आपका सिबल ठीक नहीं हो 8.7 9 9.5 तक आपका होम लोन जाता है उस केस में आपका ईएमआई बढ़ जाता है उस केस में आपको बहुत इंटरेस्ट पे करना पड़ता है तो लोगों के लिए अब होम लोन की अफॉर्डेबिलिटी थोड़ी डिफिकल्ट होती जा रही है उस केस में भी लोगों का बाइंग पावर जो है वो थोड़ा कम होता जा रहा है और अगर मटेरियल ज्यादा बनता जाएगा इन्वेंटरी बहुत बनेगी और बाइंग पावर कम होता जाएगा तो भी मार्केट में गैप आएगा स्लो डाउन आने के चांसेस है तो मार्केट में करेक्शन आ सकता है अगर ये चीजें कंटिन्यू रही तो चौथा बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट लेकिन पॉइंट नंबर फोर जानने से पहले दोस्तों मैं कहूंगा आपको कि अगर आपने चैनल को सब्सक्राइब नहीं किया तो तुरंत सब्सक्राइब करके बेल आइकॉन को हिट करो हम नहीं चाहते ऐसे इंपॉर्टेंट वैल्यू एडेड रियल एस्टेट के वीडियोस कभी आपके मिस हो पॉइंट नंबर फोर गेटिंग परमिट टेक्स मोर टाइम बहुत इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट है बिल्डर एंड डेवलपर्स के पॉइंट ऑफ़ व्यू से बता रहा हूं कॉम्प्लेक्शन है जो अप्रूवल को डिले करते हैं जिसकी वजह से कॉस्टिंग बढ़ती है कभी-कभी क्या होता है बिल्डर बहुत बड़ा प्रोजेक्ट लॉच कर देता है उसके पहले के उसके जितने प्रोजेक्ट थे वहां हो सकता है उतनी एनओसी की जरूरत नहीं थी मान लीजिए 200 फ्लैट में आपको एनवायरमेंट की एनओसी नहीं लगी लेकिन 500 फ्लैट में आपको एनवायरमेंट की एनओसी लग रही एनवायरमेंट की एनओसी इतनी जल्दी नहीं मिल जाती थोड़ा समय लगता है जिसके वजह से प्रोजेक्ट का लॉन्च डिले हो जाता है दूसरा कॉम्प्लेक्शन होने की वजह से क्योंकि बिल्डर के पास उतना एजुकेटेड उतना स्किलफुल उतना टैलेंटेड स्टाफ नहीं होता तो वो सैंक्शनिंग का प्रोसेस डिले होने की वजह से प्रोजेक्ट कॉस्ट में भी फर्क पड़ता है दूसरा उस दौरान अगर किसी बहुत स्मार्ट बिल्डर को वहां पर जल्दी स्मार्ट कहिए या जिसकी बहुत अच्छी पहचान हो गई है जिसके पास पावर हो गई है अगर उसे जल्दी परमिशन मिल गया उसका इन्वेंटरी जल्दी लॉन्च हो जाता है जल्दी-जल्दी बिक जाता है तो जो मार्केट की डिमांड थी मान लीजिए 100 फ्लैट 200 फ्लैट 300 फ्लैट की वो खत्म हो गई और आपका प्रोजेक्ट लच होते होते छ महीना डिले हो गया एक साल डिले हो गया वहां पर जो डिमांड था वो कंज्यूम कर लिया उस बिल्डर ने जिसको जल्दी सैंक्शनिंग मिल गई दूसरा बहुत ज्यादा टीम स्किलफुल या टेक्नोलॉजी में वस ना होने की वजह से ऑनलाइन सैंक्शनिंग ऑनलाइन प्रोसेसेस लोग जल्दी नहीं कर पाते चाहे सैंक्शनिंग का प्रोसेस हो दोस्तों चाहे रीरा का प्रोसेस हो बहुत सारी चीजों में लोग डिले हो जाते हैं जिसकी वजह से भी फिर उनका इन्वेंटरी रह जाता है स्लो डाउन और क्रैश आने के चांसेस बढ़ जाते हैं तो ये बहुत इंपॉर्टेंट रीजन है हो सके तो अपने आप को अपग्रेड जल्दी कीजिए अपनी टीम को अपग्रेड कीजिए जितनी जल्दी आप इन चीजों को समझेंगे और जितनी जल्दी गवर्नमेंट भी इन प्रोसेस को और इजी कर पाएगी मुझे लगता है ये स्लो डाउन और कैश के चांसेस कम हो जाएंगे वट नंबर फाइव नॉट यूजिंग लेटेस्ट टेक्नोलॉजी ये बहुत-बहुत बड़ा इशू है ऐसा नहीं है कि मार्केट में अपग्रेडेशन नहीं है मार्केट में प्रॉपर प्रॉप टेक कंपनीज नहीं है सॉफ्टवेयर कंपनीज नहीं है सीआरएम नहीं है ईआरपी नहीं है सब कुछ है लेकिन थोड़ा सा टेक्नोलॉजी का जो अपग्रेडेशन कहिए या टेक्नोलॉजी को एक्सेप्ट करना वो फैक्टर कम होने की वजह से इन सब चीजों का यूज करके जल्दी चीजें नहीं हो पा रही है प्रॉमिस तो कर देते हैं दो साल में कंप्लीट हो हो जाएगा 3 साल में क इनके पास कोई ऐसा एफिशिएंसी नहीं होती ऐसे कोई ऑपरेशंस नहीं होते जिसके वजह से समय पे प्रोजेक्ट कंप्लीट हो जाए बड़े से बड़े बिल्डर भी डिले हो रहे हैं 1 साल 2 साल 3 साल पांच पांच साल प्रोजेक्ट कहीं-कहीं डिले हो रहे हैं जिसकी वजह से अगेन लोगों ने खरीद तो लिया समय पे प्रोजेक्ट मिला नहीं ईएमआई शुरू हो गई ऐसे बहुत सारी प्रॉब्लम्स लोगों को होते हैं तो ये कुछ ऐसे कारण है जिसके वजह से आने वाले समय में और स्लो डाउन आ सकता है इसके बहुत सारे सोलूशंस है बहुत इजी सॉल्यूशंस है अगर आप सॉल्यूशन बहुत सारे जानना चाहते हैं तो नीचे कमेंट कीजिए सलूशन या अगर 200 से ज्यादा लोगों ने इस वीडियो को लाइक किया शेयर किया तो हम पूरे सलूशन लेकर आएंगे कि कैसे इस स्लोडाउन को इस क्रैश को बचाया जा सकता है कम किया जा सकता है ये सब रिसर्च बेस्ड चीज है क्योंकि 100 से ज्यादा रियल स्टेट सीईओ से हर कोने-कोने में देश के हर सिटी हर स्टेट में बात करने के बाद हमें इतना तो जरूर पता है कि किन चीजों से किन चीजों पे कंट्रोल किया जा सकता है और 4 साल लगे उस बुक को पूरी तरह से लिखने में रियल स्टेट गेम चेंजर को जिसको आपने रियल स्टेट गेम चेंजर को एक नेशनल बेस्टसेलर बुक बनाया वो पूरी रिसर्च से हम ये जरूर बता सकते हैं कि कैसे आने वाले समय में इस स्लोडाउन को कम किया जा सकता है या इस क्रैश से बचा जा सकता है जो मैं पक्का नेक्स्ट वीडियो में लेकर आऊंगा आप सबके लिए अगर आपने इस वीडियो को ज्यादा से ज्यादा शेयर किया ज्यादा से ज्यादा कमेंट आए टाइप कीजिए सॉल्यूशन किसी और टॉपिक पर वीडियो देखना चाहते हैं नीचे कमेंट करके बताइए कौन से टॉपिक पर आप चाहते हैं हमारी टीम को वीडियो बनाए वीडियो को लाइक करना ना भूले दोस्तों आपके लाइक से मुझे और मेरी टीम को बहुत एनर्जी बहुत सपोर्ट मिलता है कि ऐसा वैल्यू एडेड कंटेंट देश में लेकर आए क्योंकि य स्ट के हर एंटरप्रेन्योर सकते हैं आने वाले समय में क्या प्रॉब्लम आ सकती है सिर्फ दो चार 10 प्लेयर्स के अच्छा करने से पूरी इंडस्ट्री में सब लोग अच्छा कर रहे हैं ऐसा नहीं है टियर टू टियर थ्री सिटी में ये प्रॉब्लम बहुत ज्यादा है टियर वन सिटीज के भी सबब एरियाज में जो डेवलपिंग एरियाज है वहां पर ये इश्यूज होते हैं लोग कैलकुलेट नहीं कर पाते कि रियल डिमांड वहां पर क्या है और प्रोजेक्ट तो लांच कर देते हो और उसके बाद प्रॉब्लम्स आना शुरू होती है 6 महीने एक साल दो साल तीन साल बाद तो अगर आपका प्रोजेक्ट मिसमैच हो रहा है अगर आपका प्रोडक्ट मैच नहीं हो रहा है अगर आप प्रॉपर रिसर्च के बिना प्रोजेक्ट लाच कर रहे है तो चांसेस है कि आपका लाखों करोड़ों रुपए लग तो जाएगा लेकिन प्रोजेक्ट उतना सफल नहीं होगा इन सब चीजों से अगर आप बच ना चाहते हैं आपको लगता है कोई एक्सपर्ट ओपिनियन की भी आपको जरूरत है आप हमारे बोर्डलाइन नंबर पे कांटेक्ट कर सकते हैं या डिस्क्रिप्शन में एक फॉर्म दिया है आरजीसी सीईओ कोचिंग का एज अ डायरेक्टर बिल्डर डेवलपर आप वो फॉर्म फिल कर सकते हैं अगर हमारी टीम आपको सेलेक्ट करती है तो मेरे साथ वन टू वन क्लेरिटी कॉल आप कर सकते हैं स्ट्रेटेजी कॉल कर सकते हैं जिसमें हम कोशिश करेंगे आपके प्रोजेक्ट को जल्दी सक्सेसफुल बनाने की और ऐसे स्लोडाउन में कहीं आपका प्रोजेक्ट ना अटक जाए इसके लिए आपको सही गाइडेंस और एक्सपर्ट ओपिनियन देने की थैंक यू सो मच फॉर योर लव थैंक यू सो मच फॉर योर सपोर्ट आपके प्यार के लिए सपोर्ट के लिए हमारे चैनल को इंडिया का लीडिंग रियल स्टेट चैनल बनाने के लिए नंबर वन चैनल बनाने के लिए हमारी बुक नेशनल बलर बुक बनाने के लिए आपका बहुत-बहुत धन्यवाद [संगीत] [संगीत]"
